Plm 	1 	1 	1 	aul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
Plm 	1 	2 	1 	And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:
Plm 	1 	3 	1 	Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Plm 	1 	4 	1 	I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
Plm 	1 	5 	1 	Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
Plm 	1 	6 	1 	That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
Plm 	1 	7 	1 	For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
Plm 	1 	8 	1 	Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,
Plm 	1 	9 	1 	Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
Plm 	1 	10 	1 	I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
Plm 	1 	11 	1 	Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:
Plm 	1 	12 	1 	Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
Plm 	1 	13 	1 	Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
Plm 	1 	14 	1 	But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
Plm 	1 	15 	1 	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
Plm 	1 	16 	1 	Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
Plm 	1 	17 	1 	If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
Plm 	1 	18 	1 	If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;
Plm 	1 	19 	1 	I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
Plm 	1 	20 	1 	Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
Plm 	1 	21 	1 	Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
Plm 	1 	22 	1 	But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
Plm 	1 	23 	1 	There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
Plm 	1 	24 	1 	Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
Plm 	1 	25 	1 	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Plm 	1 	25 	2 	Amen.
