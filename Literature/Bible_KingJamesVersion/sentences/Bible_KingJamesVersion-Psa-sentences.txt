Psa 	1 	1 	1 	Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
Psa 	1 	2 	1 	But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
Psa 	1 	3 	1 	And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
Psa 	1 	4 	1 	The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
Psa 	1 	5 	1 	Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
Psa 	1 	6 	1 	For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
Psa 	2 	1 	1 	Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
Psa 	2 	2 	1 	The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,
Psa 	2 	3 	1 	Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
Psa 	2 	4 	1 	He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.
Psa 	2 	5 	1 	Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.
Psa 	2 	6 	1 	Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
Psa 	2 	7 	1 	I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
Psa 	2 	8 	1 	Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Psa 	2 	9 	1 	Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
Psa 	2 	10 	1 	Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
Psa 	2 	11 	1 	Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
Psa 	2 	12 	1 	Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.
Psa 	2 	12 	2 	Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
Psa 	3 	1 	1 	Lord, how are they increased that trouble me!
Psa 	3 	1 	2 	many are they that rise up against me.
Psa 	3 	2 	1 	Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God.
Psa 	3 	2 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	3 	3 	1 	But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
Psa 	3 	4 	1 	I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill.
Psa 	3 	4 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	3 	5 	1 	I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
Psa 	3 	6 	1 	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.
Psa 	3 	7 	1 	Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Psa 	3 	8 	1 	Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people.
Psa 	3 	8 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	4 	1 	1 	Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
Psa 	4 	2 	1 	O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?
Psa 	4 	2 	2 	how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing?
Psa 	4 	2 	3 	Selah.
Psa 	4 	3 	1 	But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.
Psa 	4 	4 	1 	Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.
Psa 	4 	4 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	4 	5 	1 	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.
Psa 	4 	6 	1 	There be many that say, Who will shew us any good?
Psa 	4 	6 	2 	LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
Psa 	4 	7 	1 	Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.
Psa 	4 	8 	1 	I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.
Psa 	5 	1 	1 	Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
Psa 	5 	2 	1 	Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.
Psa 	5 	3 	1 	My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.
Psa 	5 	4 	1 	For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.
Psa 	5 	5 	1 	The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
Psa 	5 	6 	1 	Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
Psa 	5 	7 	1 	But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Psa 	5 	8 	1 	Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
Psa 	5 	9 	1 	For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
Psa 	5 	10 	1 	Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
Psa 	5 	11 	1 	But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
Psa 	5 	12 	1 	For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
Psa 	6 	1 	1 	O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
Psa 	6 	2 	1 	Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.
Psa 	6 	3 	1 	My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?
Psa 	6 	4 	1 	Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.
Psa 	6 	5 	1 	For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
Psa 	6 	6 	1 	I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
Psa 	6 	7 	1 	Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
Psa 	6 	8 	1 	Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.
Psa 	6 	9 	1 	The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.
Psa 	6 	10 	1 	Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.
Psa 	7 	1 	1 	O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:
Psa 	7 	2 	1 	Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
Psa 	7 	3 	1 	O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;
Psa 	7 	4 	1 	If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
Psa 	7 	5 	1 	Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.
Psa 	7 	5 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	7 	6 	1 	Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.
Psa 	7 	7 	1 	So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
Psa 	7 	8 	1 	The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.
Psa 	7 	9 	1 	Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
Psa 	7 	10 	1 	My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
Psa 	7 	11 	1 	God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.
Psa 	7 	12 	1 	If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
Psa 	7 	13 	1 	He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
Psa 	7 	14 	1 	Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
Psa 	7 	15 	1 	He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.
Psa 	7 	16 	1 	His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
Psa 	7 	17 	1 	I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
Psa 	8 	1 	1 	O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
Psa 	8 	1 	2 	who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
Psa 	8 	2 	1 	Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
Psa 	8 	3 	1 	When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
Psa 	8 	4 	1 	What is man, that thou art mindful of him?
Psa 	8 	4 	2 	and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
Psa 	8 	5 	1 	For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
Psa 	8 	6 	1 	Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:
Psa 	8 	7 	1 	All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
Psa 	8 	8 	1 	The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
Psa 	8 	9 	1 	O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
Psa 	9 	1 	1 	I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.
Psa 	9 	2 	1 	I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.
Psa 	9 	3 	1 	When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
Psa 	9 	4 	1 	For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
Psa 	9 	5 	1 	Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
Psa 	9 	6 	1 	O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
Psa 	9 	7 	1 	But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.
Psa 	9 	8 	1 	And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
Psa 	9 	9 	1 	The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
Psa 	9 	10 	1 	And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
Psa 	9 	11 	1 	Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.
Psa 	9 	12 	1 	When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
Psa 	9 	13 	1 	Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
Psa 	9 	14 	1 	That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
Psa 	9 	15 	1 	The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
Psa 	9 	16 	1 	The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.
Psa 	9 	16 	2 	Higgaion.
Psa 	9 	16 	3 	Selah.
Psa 	9 	17 	1 	The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.
Psa 	9 	18 	1 	For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.
Psa 	9 	19 	1 	Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.
Psa 	9 	20 	1 	ut them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men.
Psa 	9 	20 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	10 	1 	1 	Why standest thou afar off, O LORD?
Psa 	10 	1 	2 	why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
Psa 	10 	2 	1 	The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
Psa 	10 	3 	1 	For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.
Psa 	10 	4 	1 	The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
Psa 	10 	5 	1 	His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
Psa 	10 	6 	1 	He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.
Psa 	10 	7 	1 	His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.
Psa 	10 	8 	1 	He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.
Psa 	10 	9 	1 	He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.
Psa 	10 	10 	1 	He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.
Psa 	10 	11 	1 	He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.
Psa 	10 	12 	1 	Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.
Psa 	10 	13 	1 	Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God?
Psa 	10 	13 	2 	he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.
Psa 	10 	14 	1 	Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.
Psa 	10 	15 	1 	Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.
Psa 	10 	16 	1 	The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.
Psa 	10 	17 	1 	LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
Psa 	10 	18 	1 	To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
Psa 	11 	1 	1 	In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?
Psa 	11 	2 	1 	For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
Psa 	11 	3 	1 	If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
Psa 	11 	4 	1 	The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
Psa 	11 	5 	1 	The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
Psa 	11 	6 	1 	Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.
Psa 	11 	7 	1 	For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
Psa 	12 	1 	1 	Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.
Psa 	12 	2 	1 	They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.
Psa 	12 	3 	1 	The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:
Psa 	12 	4 	1 	Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?
Psa 	12 	5 	1 	For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.
Psa 	12 	6 	1 	The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
Psa 	12 	7 	1 	Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
Psa 	12 	8 	1 	The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
Psa 	13 	1 	1 	How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD?
Psa 	13 	1 	2 	for ever?
Psa 	13 	1 	3 	how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
Psa 	13 	2 	1 	How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily?
Psa 	13 	2 	2 	how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
Psa 	13 	3 	1 	Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;
Psa 	13 	4 	1 	Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
Psa 	13 	5 	1 	But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
Psa 	13 	6 	1 	I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
Psa 	14 	1 	1 	The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.
Psa 	14 	1 	2 	They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.
Psa 	14 	2 	1 	The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.
Psa 	14 	3 	1 	They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
Psa 	14 	4 	1 	Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?
Psa 	14 	4 	2 	who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.
Psa 	14 	5 	1 	There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.
Psa 	14 	6 	1 	Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge.
Psa 	14 	7 	1 	Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!
Psa 	14 	7 	2 	when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
Psa 	15 	1 	1 	Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle?
Psa 	15 	1 	2 	who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
Psa 	15 	2 	1 	He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.
Psa 	15 	3 	1 	He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.
Psa 	15 	4 	1 	In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD.
Psa 	15 	4 	2 	He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.
Psa 	15 	5 	1 	He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent.
Psa 	15 	5 	2 	He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
Psa 	16 	1 	1 	reserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
Psa 	16 	2 	1 	O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;
Psa 	16 	3 	1 	But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.
Psa 	16 	4 	1 	Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.
Psa 	16 	5 	1 	The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.
Psa 	16 	6 	1 	The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
Psa 	16 	7 	1 	I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.
Psa 	16 	8 	1 	I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
Psa 	16 	9 	1 	Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
Psa 	16 	10 	1 	For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
Psa 	16 	11 	1 	Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
Psa 	17 	1 	1 	Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Psa 	17 	2 	1 	Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.
Psa 	17 	3 	1 	Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
Psa 	17 	4 	1 	Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.
Psa 	17 	5 	1 	Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
Psa 	17 	6 	1 	I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.
Psa 	17 	7 	1 	Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.
Psa 	17 	8 	1 	Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
Psa 	17 	9 	1 	From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.
Psa 	17 	10 	1 	They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.
Psa 	17 	11 	1 	They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;
Psa 	17 	12 	1 	Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
Psa 	17 	13 	1 	Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:
Psa 	17 	14 	1 	From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
Psa 	17 	15 	1 	As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
Psa 	18 	1 	1 	I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
Psa 	18 	2 	1 	The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.
Psa 	18 	3 	1 	I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
Psa 	18 	4 	1 	The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
Psa 	18 	5 	1 	The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.
Psa 	18 	6 	1 	In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.
Psa 	18 	7 	1 	Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
Psa 	18 	8 	1 	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
Psa 	18 	9 	1 	He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.
Psa 	18 	10 	1 	And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
Psa 	18 	11 	1 	He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
Psa 	18 	12 	1 	At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.
Psa 	18 	13 	1 	The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.
Psa 	18 	14 	1 	Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
Psa 	18 	15 	1 	Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
Psa 	18 	16 	1 	He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
Psa 	18 	17 	1 	He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.
Psa 	18 	18 	1 	They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
Psa 	18 	19 	1 	He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
Psa 	18 	20 	1 	The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
Psa 	18 	21 	1 	For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
Psa 	18 	22 	1 	For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
Psa 	18 	23 	1 	I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
Psa 	18 	24 	1 	Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
Psa 	18 	25 	1 	With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
Psa 	18 	26 	1 	With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.
Psa 	18 	27 	1 	For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.
Psa 	18 	28 	1 	For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.
Psa 	18 	29 	1 	For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
Psa 	18 	30 	1 	As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.
Psa 	18 	31 	1 	For who is God save the LORD?
Psa 	18 	31 	2 	or who is a rock save our God?
Psa 	18 	32 	1 	It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.
Psa 	18 	33 	1 	He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.
Psa 	18 	34 	1 	He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
Psa 	18 	35 	1 	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
Psa 	18 	36 	1 	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
Psa 	18 	37 	1 	I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
Psa 	18 	38 	1 	I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.
Psa 	18 	39 	1 	For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
Psa 	18 	40 	1 	Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.
Psa 	18 	41 	1 	They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
Psa 	18 	42 	1 	Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
Psa 	18 	43 	1 	Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.
Psa 	18 	44 	1 	As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
Psa 	18 	45 	1 	The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.
Psa 	18 	46 	1 	The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
Psa 	18 	47 	1 	It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
Psa 	18 	48 	1 	He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
Psa 	18 	49 	1 	Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.
Psa 	18 	50 	1 	Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
Psa 	19 	1 	1 	The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.
Psa 	19 	2 	1 	Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
Psa 	19 	3 	1 	There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
Psa 	19 	4 	1 	Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.
Psa 	19 	4 	2 	In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
Psa 	19 	5 	1 	Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.
Psa 	19 	6 	1 	His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
Psa 	19 	7 	1 	The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
Psa 	19 	8 	1 	The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.
Psa 	19 	9 	1 	The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.
Psa 	19 	10 	1 	More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
Psa 	19 	11 	1 	Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.
Psa 	19 	12 	1 	Who can understand his errors?
Psa 	19 	12 	2 	cleanse thou me from secret faults.
Psa 	19 	13 	1 	Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
Psa 	19 	14 	1 	Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.
Psa 	20 	1 	1 	The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;
Psa 	20 	2 	1 	Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;
Psa 	20 	3 	1 	Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.
Psa 	20 	4 	1 	Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.
Psa 	20 	5 	1 	We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.
Psa 	20 	6 	1 	Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.
Psa 	20 	7 	1 	Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.
Psa 	20 	8 	1 	They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Psa 	20 	9 	1 	Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
Psa 	21 	1 	1 	The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
Psa 	21 	2 	1 	Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips.
Psa 	21 	2 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	21 	3 	1 	For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.
Psa 	21 	4 	1 	He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.
Psa 	21 	5 	1 	His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.
Psa 	21 	6 	1 	For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
Psa 	21 	7 	1 	For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.
Psa 	21 	8 	1 	Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
Psa 	21 	9 	1 	Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
Psa 	21 	10 	1 	Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
Psa 	21 	11 	1 	For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.
Psa 	21 	12 	1 	Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.
Psa 	21 	13 	1 	Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.
Psa 	22 	1 	1 	My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Psa 	22 	1 	2 	why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?
Psa 	22 	2 	1 	O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.
Psa 	22 	3 	1 	But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
Psa 	22 	4 	1 	Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
Psa 	22 	5 	1 	They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
Psa 	22 	6 	1 	But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.
Psa 	22 	7 	1 	All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
Psa 	22 	8 	1 	He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.
Psa 	22 	9 	1 	But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.
Psa 	22 	10 	1 	I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly.
Psa 	22 	11 	1 	Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.
Psa 	22 	12 	1 	Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
Psa 	22 	13 	1 	They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.
Psa 	22 	14 	1 	I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
Psa 	22 	15 	1 	My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
Psa 	22 	16 	1 	For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
Psa 	22 	17 	1 	I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.
Psa 	22 	18 	1 	They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
Psa 	22 	19 	1 	But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.
Psa 	22 	20 	1 	Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.
Psa 	22 	21 	1 	Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.
Psa 	22 	22 	1 	I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
Psa 	22 	23 	1 	Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.
Psa 	22 	24 	1 	For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.
Psa 	22 	25 	1 	My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
Psa 	22 	26 	1 	The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.
Psa 	22 	27 	1 	All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
Psa 	22 	28 	1 	For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations.
Psa 	22 	29 	1 	All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.
Psa 	22 	30 	1 	A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.
Psa 	22 	31 	1 	They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.
Psa 	23 	1 	1 	The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
Psa 	23 	2 	1 	He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
Psa 	23 	3 	1 	He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Psa 	23 	4 	1 	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
Psa 	23 	5 	1 	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Psa 	23 	6 	1 	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
Psa 	24 	1 	1 	The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
Psa 	24 	2 	1 	For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.
Psa 	24 	3 	1 	Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD?
Psa 	24 	3 	2 	or who shall stand in his holy place?
Psa 	24 	4 	1 	He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
Psa 	24 	5 	1 	He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
Psa 	24 	6 	1 	This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob.
Psa 	24 	6 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	24 	7 	1 	Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
Psa 	24 	8 	1 	Who is this King of glory?
Psa 	24 	8 	2 	The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.
Psa 	24 	9 	1 	Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
Psa 	24 	10 	1 	Who is this King of glory?
Psa 	24 	10 	2 	The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory.
Psa 	24 	10 	3 	Selah.
Psa 	25 	1 	1 	Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.
Psa 	25 	2 	1 	O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.
Psa 	25 	3 	1 	Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.
Psa 	25 	4 	1 	Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.
Psa 	25 	5 	1 	Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.
Psa 	25 	6 	1 	Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.
Psa 	25 	7 	1 	Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.
Psa 	25 	8 	1 	Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
Psa 	25 	9 	1 	The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.
Psa 	25 	10 	1 	All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
Psa 	25 	11 	1 	For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.
Psa 	25 	12 	1 	What man is he that feareth the LORD?
Psa 	25 	12 	2 	him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.
Psa 	25 	13 	1 	His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.
Psa 	25 	14 	1 	The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.
Psa 	25 	15 	1 	Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.
Psa 	25 	16 	1 	Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.
Psa 	25 	17 	1 	The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.
Psa 	25 	18 	1 	Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.
Psa 	25 	19 	1 	Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.
Psa 	25 	20 	1 	O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.
Psa 	25 	21 	1 	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
Psa 	25 	22 	1 	Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
Psa 	26 	1 	1 	Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.
Psa 	26 	2 	1 	Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
Psa 	26 	3 	1 	For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.
Psa 	26 	4 	1 	I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.
Psa 	26 	5 	1 	I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.
Psa 	26 	6 	1 	I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:
Psa 	26 	7 	1 	That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.
Psa 	26 	8 	1 	LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.
Psa 	26 	9 	1 	Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:
Psa 	26 	10 	1 	In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.
Psa 	26 	11 	1 	But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.
Psa 	26 	12 	1 	My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
Psa 	27 	1 	1 	The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?
Psa 	27 	1 	2 	the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
Psa 	27 	2 	1 	When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
Psa 	27 	3 	1 	Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.
Psa 	27 	4 	1 	One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.
Psa 	27 	5 	1 	For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.
Psa 	27 	6 	1 	And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.
Psa 	27 	7 	1 	Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
Psa 	27 	8 	1 	When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.
Psa 	27 	9 	1 	Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
Psa 	27 	10 	1 	When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.
Psa 	27 	11 	1 	Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.
Psa 	27 	12 	1 	Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.
Psa 	27 	13 	1 	I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.
Psa 	27 	14 	1 	Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.
Psa 	28 	1 	1 	Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
Psa 	28 	2 	1 	Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
Psa 	28 	3 	1 	Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.
Psa 	28 	4 	1 	Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.
Psa 	28 	5 	1 	Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.
Psa 	28 	6 	1 	Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
Psa 	28 	7 	1 	The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.
Psa 	28 	8 	1 	The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.
Psa 	28 	9 	1 	Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.
Psa 	29 	1 	1 	Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength.
Psa 	29 	2 	1 	Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
Psa 	29 	3 	1 	The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.
Psa 	29 	4 	1 	The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.
Psa 	29 	5 	1 	The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.
Psa 	29 	6 	1 	He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.
Psa 	29 	7 	1 	The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.
Psa 	29 	8 	1 	The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
Psa 	29 	9 	1 	The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.
Psa 	29 	10 	1 	The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever.
Psa 	29 	11 	1 	The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.
Psa 	30 	1 	1 	I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
Psa 	30 	2 	1 	O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
Psa 	30 	3 	1 	O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
Psa 	30 	4 	1 	Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
Psa 	30 	5 	1 	For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
Psa 	30 	6 	1 	And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
Psa 	30 	7 	1 	LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.
Psa 	30 	8 	1 	I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.
Psa 	30 	9 	1 	What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
Psa 	30 	9 	2 	Shall the dust praise thee?
Psa 	30 	9 	3 	shall it declare thy truth?
Psa 	30 	10 	1 	Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.
Psa 	30 	11 	1 	Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
Psa 	30 	12 	1 	To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent.
Psa 	30 	12 	2 	O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
Psa 	31 	1 	1 	In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.
Psa 	31 	2 	1 	Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.
Psa 	31 	3 	1 	For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.
Psa 	31 	4 	1 	ull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.
Psa 	31 	5 	1 	Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.
Psa 	31 	6 	1 	I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.
Psa 	31 	7 	1 	I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;
Psa 	31 	8 	1 	And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.
Psa 	31 	9 	1 	Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.
Psa 	31 	10 	1 	For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.
Psa 	31 	11 	1 	I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.
Psa 	31 	12 	1 	I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.
Psa 	31 	13 	1 	For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.
Psa 	31 	14 	1 	But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.
Psa 	31 	15 	1 	My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
Psa 	31 	16 	1 	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.
Psa 	31 	17 	1 	Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.
Psa 	31 	18 	1 	Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
Psa 	31 	19 	1 	Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!
Psa 	31 	20 	1 	Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
Psa 	31 	21 	1 	Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.
Psa 	31 	22 	1 	For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.
Psa 	31 	23 	1 	O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.
Psa 	31 	24 	1 	Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.
Psa 	32 	1 	1 	Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
Psa 	32 	2 	1 	Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
Psa 	32 	3 	1 	When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.
Psa 	32 	4 	1 	For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer.
Psa 	32 	4 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	32 	5 	1 	I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid.
Psa 	32 	5 	2 	I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.
Psa 	32 	5 	3 	Selah.
Psa 	32 	6 	1 	For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
Psa 	32 	7 	1 	Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.
Psa 	32 	7 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	32 	8 	1 	I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.
Psa 	32 	9 	1 	Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.
Psa 	32 	10 	1 	Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.
Psa 	32 	11 	1 	Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
Psa 	33 	1 	1 	Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.
Psa 	33 	2 	1 	raise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.
Psa 	33 	3 	1 	Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
Psa 	33 	4 	1 	For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.
Psa 	33 	5 	1 	He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.
Psa 	33 	6 	1 	By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
Psa 	33 	7 	1 	He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.
Psa 	33 	8 	1 	Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
Psa 	33 	9 	1 	For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.
Psa 	33 	10 	1 	The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.
Psa 	33 	11 	1 	The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
Psa 	33 	12 	1 	Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
Psa 	33 	13 	1 	The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.
Psa 	33 	14 	1 	From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
Psa 	33 	15 	1 	He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.
Psa 	33 	16 	1 	There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
Psa 	33 	17 	1 	An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.
Psa 	33 	18 	1 	Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;
Psa 	33 	19 	1 	To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
Psa 	33 	20 	1 	Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.
Psa 	33 	21 	1 	For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.
Psa 	33 	22 	1 	Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
Psa 	34 	1 	1 	I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
Psa 	34 	2 	1 	My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.
Psa 	34 	3 	1 	O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.
Psa 	34 	4 	1 	I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
Psa 	34 	5 	1 	They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.
Psa 	34 	6 	1 	This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.
Psa 	34 	7 	1 	The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.
Psa 	34 	8 	1 	O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
Psa 	34 	9 	1 	O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.
Psa 	34 	10 	1 	The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.
Psa 	34 	11 	1 	Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
Psa 	34 	12 	1 	What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?
Psa 	34 	13 	1 	Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
Psa 	34 	14 	1 	Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
Psa 	34 	15 	1 	The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.
Psa 	34 	16 	1 	The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
Psa 	34 	17 	1 	The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.
Psa 	34 	18 	1 	The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.
Psa 	34 	19 	1 	Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.
Psa 	34 	20 	1 	He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.
Psa 	34 	21 	1 	Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.
Psa 	34 	22 	1 	The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.
Psa 	35 	1 	1 	lead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.
Psa 	35 	2 	1 	Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.
Psa 	35 	3 	1 	Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
Psa 	35 	4 	1 	Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.
Psa 	35 	5 	1 	Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.
Psa 	35 	6 	1 	Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.
Psa 	35 	7 	1 	For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul.
Psa 	35 	8 	1 	Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.
Psa 	35 	9 	1 	And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.
Psa 	35 	10 	1 	All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?
Psa 	35 	11 	1 	False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
Psa 	35 	12 	1 	They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.
Psa 	35 	13 	1 	But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.
Psa 	35 	14 	1 	I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.
Psa 	35 	15 	1 	But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:
Psa 	35 	16 	1 	With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Psa 	35 	17 	1 	Lord, how long wilt thou look on?
Psa 	35 	17 	2 	rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.
Psa 	35 	18 	1 	I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.
Psa 	35 	19 	1 	Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
Psa 	35 	20 	1 	For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.
Psa 	35 	21 	1 	Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.
Psa 	35 	22 	1 	This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.
Psa 	35 	23 	1 	Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.
Psa 	35 	24 	1 	Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.
Psa 	35 	25 	1 	Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
Psa 	35 	26 	1 	Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.
Psa 	35 	27 	1 	Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
Psa 	35 	28 	1 	And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.
Psa 	36 	1 	1 	The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.
Psa 	36 	2 	1 	For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.
Psa 	36 	3 	1 	The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.
Psa 	36 	4 	1 	He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.
Psa 	36 	5 	1 	Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.
Psa 	36 	6 	1 	Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.
Psa 	36 	7 	1 	How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God!
Psa 	36 	7 	2 	therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
Psa 	36 	8 	1 	They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
Psa 	36 	9 	1 	For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.
Psa 	36 	10 	1 	O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
Psa 	36 	11 	1 	Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.
Psa 	36 	12 	1 	There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.
Psa 	37 	1 	1 	Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.
Psa 	37 	2 	1 	For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.
Psa 	37 	3 	1 	Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.
Psa 	37 	4 	1 	Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.
Psa 	37 	5 	1 	Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.
Psa 	37 	6 	1 	And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.
Psa 	37 	7 	1 	Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
Psa 	37 	8 	1 	Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.
Psa 	37 	9 	1 	For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.
Psa 	37 	10 	1 	For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.
Psa 	37 	11 	1 	But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
Psa 	37 	12 	1 	The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
Psa 	37 	13 	1 	The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.
Psa 	37 	14 	1 	The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.
Psa 	37 	15 	1 	Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
Psa 	37 	16 	1 	A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.
Psa 	37 	17 	1 	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.
Psa 	37 	18 	1 	The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.
Psa 	37 	19 	1 	They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
Psa 	37 	20 	1 	But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.
Psa 	37 	21 	1 	The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.
Psa 	37 	22 	1 	For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.
Psa 	37 	23 	1 	The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.
Psa 	37 	24 	1 	Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.
Psa 	37 	25 	1 	I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
Psa 	37 	26 	1 	He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.
Psa 	37 	27 	1 	Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.
Psa 	37 	28 	1 	For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
Psa 	37 	29 	1 	The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.
Psa 	37 	30 	1 	The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.
Psa 	37 	31 	1 	The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.
Psa 	37 	32 	1 	The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
Psa 	37 	33 	1 	The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.
Psa 	37 	34 	1 	Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
Psa 	37 	35 	1 	I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.
Psa 	37 	36 	1 	Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
Psa 	37 	37 	1 	Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.
Psa 	37 	38 	1 	But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.
Psa 	37 	39 	1 	But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.
Psa 	37 	40 	1 	And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.
Psa 	38 	1 	1 	O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
Psa 	38 	2 	1 	For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
Psa 	38 	3 	1 	There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.
Psa 	38 	4 	1 	For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
Psa 	38 	5 	1 	My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
Psa 	38 	6 	1 	I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
Psa 	38 	7 	1 	For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.
Psa 	38 	8 	1 	I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
Psa 	38 	9 	1 	Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.
Psa 	38 	10 	1 	My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
Psa 	38 	11 	1 	My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.
Psa 	38 	12 	1 	They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.
Psa 	38 	13 	1 	But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
Psa 	38 	14 	1 	Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
Psa 	38 	15 	1 	For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
Psa 	38 	16 	1 	For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
Psa 	38 	17 	1 	For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
Psa 	38 	18 	1 	For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
Psa 	38 	19 	1 	But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
Psa 	38 	20 	1 	They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.
Psa 	38 	21 	1 	Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.
Psa 	38 	22 	1 	Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
Psa 	39 	1 	1 	I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.
Psa 	39 	2 	1 	I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.
Psa 	39 	3 	1 	My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,
Psa 	39 	4 	1 	LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.
Psa 	39 	5 	1 	Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity.
Psa 	39 	5 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	39 	6 	1 	Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
Psa 	39 	7 	1 	And now, Lord, what wait I for?
Psa 	39 	7 	2 	my hope is in thee.
Psa 	39 	8 	1 	Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.
Psa 	39 	9 	1 	I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.
Psa 	39 	10 	1 	Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.
Psa 	39 	11 	1 	When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity.
Psa 	39 	11 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	39 	12 	1 	Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
Psa 	39 	13 	1 	O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
Psa 	40 	1 	1 	I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
Psa 	40 	2 	1 	He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
Psa 	40 	3 	1 	And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.
Psa 	40 	4 	1 	Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
Psa 	40 	5 	1 	Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.
Psa 	40 	6 	1 	Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
Psa 	40 	7 	1 	Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,
Psa 	40 	8 	1 	I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.
Psa 	40 	9 	1 	I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.
Psa 	40 	10 	1 	I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.
Psa 	40 	11 	1 	Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
Psa 	40 	12 	1 	For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.
Psa 	40 	13 	1 	Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.
Psa 	40 	14 	1 	Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
Psa 	40 	15 	1 	Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.
Psa 	40 	16 	1 	Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.
Psa 	40 	17 	1 	But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
Psa 	41 	1 	1 	Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.
Psa 	41 	2 	1 	The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.
Psa 	41 	3 	1 	The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.
Psa 	41 	4 	1 	I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
Psa 	41 	5 	1 	Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?
Psa 	41 	6 	1 	And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.
Psa 	41 	7 	1 	All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.
Psa 	41 	8 	1 	An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.
Psa 	41 	9 	1 	Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
Psa 	41 	10 	1 	But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.
Psa 	41 	11 	1 	By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
Psa 	41 	12 	1 	And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.
Psa 	41 	13 	1 	Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting.
Psa 	41 	13 	2 	Amen, and Amen.
Psa 	42 	1 	1 	As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.
Psa 	42 	2 	1 	My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?
Psa 	42 	3 	1 	My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?
Psa 	42 	4 	1 	When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.
Psa 	42 	5 	1 	Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
Psa 	42 	5 	2 	and why art thou disquieted in me?
Psa 	42 	5 	3 	hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.
Psa 	42 	6 	1 	O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.
Psa 	42 	7 	1 	Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
Psa 	42 	8 	1 	Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.
Psa 	42 	9 	1 	I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me?
Psa 	42 	9 	2 	why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
Psa 	42 	10 	1 	As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?
Psa 	42 	11 	1 	Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
Psa 	42 	11 	2 	and why art thou disquieted within me?
Psa 	42 	11 	3 	hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.
Psa 	43 	1 	1 	Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
Psa 	43 	2 	1 	For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off?
Psa 	43 	2 	2 	why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
Psa 	43 	3 	1 	O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.
Psa 	43 	4 	1 	Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.
Psa 	43 	5 	1 	Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
Psa 	43 	5 	2 	and why art thou disquieted within me?
Psa 	43 	5 	3 	hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.
Psa 	44 	1 	1 	We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.
Psa 	44 	2 	1 	How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
Psa 	44 	3 	1 	For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.
Psa 	44 	4 	1 	Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.
Psa 	44 	5 	1 	Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
Psa 	44 	6 	1 	For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
Psa 	44 	7 	1 	But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.
Psa 	44 	8 	1 	In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever.
Psa 	44 	8 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	44 	9 	1 	But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.
Psa 	44 	10 	1 	Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.
Psa 	44 	11 	1 	Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Psa 	44 	12 	1 	Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.
Psa 	44 	13 	1 	Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
Psa 	44 	14 	1 	Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.
Psa 	44 	15 	1 	My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,
Psa 	44 	16 	1 	For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.
Psa 	44 	17 	1 	All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
Psa 	44 	18 	1 	Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;
Psa 	44 	19 	1 	Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.
Psa 	44 	20 	1 	If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;
Psa 	44 	21 	1 	Shall not God search this out?
Psa 	44 	21 	2 	for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
Psa 	44 	22 	1 	Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
Psa 	44 	23 	1 	Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?
Psa 	44 	23 	2 	arise, cast us not off for ever.
Psa 	44 	24 	1 	Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
Psa 	44 	25 	1 	For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.
Psa 	44 	26 	1 	Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.
Psa 	45 	1 	1 	My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
Psa 	45 	2 	1 	Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
Psa 	45 	3 	1 	Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.
Psa 	45 	4 	1 	And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
Psa 	45 	5 	1 	Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.
Psa 	45 	6 	1 	Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
Psa 	45 	7 	1 	Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
Psa 	45 	8 	1 	All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.
Psa 	45 	9 	1 	Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
Psa 	45 	10 	1 	Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
Psa 	45 	11 	1 	So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.
Psa 	45 	12 	1 	And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.
Psa 	45 	13 	1 	The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
Psa 	45 	14 	1 	She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
Psa 	45 	15 	1 	With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.
Psa 	45 	16 	1 	Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.
Psa 	45 	17 	1 	I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
Psa 	46 	1 	1 	God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
Psa 	46 	2 	1 	Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
Psa 	46 	3 	1 	Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.
Psa 	46 	3 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	46 	4 	1 	There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.
Psa 	46 	5 	1 	God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.
Psa 	46 	6 	1 	The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
Psa 	46 	7 	1 	The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
Psa 	46 	7 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	46 	8 	1 	Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.
Psa 	46 	9 	1 	He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.
Psa 	46 	10 	1 	Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
Psa 	46 	11 	1 	The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
Psa 	46 	11 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	47 	1 	1 	O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
Psa 	47 	2 	1 	For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth.
Psa 	47 	3 	1 	He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.
Psa 	47 	4 	1 	He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved.
Psa 	47 	4 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	47 	5 	1 	God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.
Psa 	47 	6 	1 	Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
Psa 	47 	7 	1 	For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
Psa 	47 	8 	1 	God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.
Psa 	47 	9 	1 	The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.
Psa 	48 	1 	1 	Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness.
Psa 	48 	2 	1 	Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.
Psa 	48 	3 	1 	God is known in her palaces for a refuge.
Psa 	48 	4 	1 	For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.
Psa 	48 	5 	1 	They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.
Psa 	48 	6 	1 	Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.
Psa 	48 	7 	1 	Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
Psa 	48 	8 	1 	As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.
Psa 	48 	8 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	48 	9 	1 	We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.
Psa 	48 	10 	1 	According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.
Psa 	48 	11 	1 	Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.
Psa 	48 	12 	1 	Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.
Psa 	48 	13 	1 	Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.
Psa 	48 	14 	1 	For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.
Psa 	49 	1 	1 	Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:
Psa 	49 	2 	1 	Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
Psa 	49 	3 	1 	My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
Psa 	49 	4 	1 	I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
Psa 	49 	5 	1 	Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
Psa 	49 	6 	1 	They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
Psa 	49 	7 	1 	None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:
Psa 	49 	8 	1 	(For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)
Psa 	49 	9 	1 	That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.
Psa 	49 	10 	1 	For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
Psa 	49 	11 	1 	Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.
Psa 	49 	12 	1 	Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.
Psa 	49 	13 	1 	This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings.
Psa 	49 	13 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	49 	14 	1 	Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
Psa 	49 	15 	1 	But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me.
Psa 	49 	15 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	49 	16 	1 	Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
Psa 	49 	17 	1 	For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
Psa 	49 	18 	1 	Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.
Psa 	49 	19 	1 	He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.
Psa 	49 	20 	1 	Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.
Psa 	50 	1 	1 	The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
Psa 	50 	2 	1 	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
Psa 	50 	3 	1 	Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
Psa 	50 	4 	1 	He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.
Psa 	50 	5 	1 	Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
Psa 	50 	6 	1 	And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself.
Psa 	50 	6 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	50 	7 	1 	Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.
Psa 	50 	8 	1 	I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.
Psa 	50 	9 	1 	I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.
Psa 	50 	10 	1 	For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.
Psa 	50 	11 	1 	I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.
Psa 	50 	12 	1 	If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.
Psa 	50 	13 	1 	Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
Psa 	50 	14 	1 	Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:
Psa 	50 	15 	1 	And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
Psa 	50 	16 	1 	But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?
Psa 	50 	17 	1 	Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind thee.
Psa 	50 	18 	1 	When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.
Psa 	50 	19 	1 	Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.
Psa 	50 	20 	1 	Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.
Psa 	50 	21 	1 	These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.
Psa 	50 	22 	1 	Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.
Psa 	50 	23 	1 	Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.
Psa 	51 	1 	1 	Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
Psa 	51 	2 	1 	Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
Psa 	51 	3 	1 	For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
Psa 	51 	4 	1 	Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.
Psa 	51 	5 	1 	Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
Psa 	51 	6 	1 	Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
Psa 	51 	7 	1 	urge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
Psa 	51 	8 	1 	Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
Psa 	51 	9 	1 	Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
Psa 	51 	10 	1 	Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
Psa 	51 	11 	1 	Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
Psa 	51 	12 	1 	Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.
Psa 	51 	13 	1 	Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
Psa 	51 	14 	1 	Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
Psa 	51 	15 	1 	O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.
Psa 	51 	16 	1 	For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.
Psa 	51 	17 	1 	The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
Psa 	51 	18 	1 	Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Psa 	51 	19 	1 	Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
Psa 	52 	1 	1 	Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man?
Psa 	52 	1 	2 	the goodness of God endureth continually.
Psa 	52 	2 	1 	The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
Psa 	52 	3 	1 	Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness.
Psa 	52 	3 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	52 	4 	1 	Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.
Psa 	52 	5 	1 	God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living.
Psa 	52 	5 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	52 	6 	1 	The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:
Psa 	52 	7 	1 	Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
Psa 	52 	8 	1 	But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
Psa 	52 	9 	1 	I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.
Psa 	53 	1 	1 	The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.
Psa 	53 	1 	2 	Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.
Psa 	53 	2 	1 	God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.
Psa 	53 	3 	1 	Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
Psa 	53 	4 	1 	Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge?
Psa 	53 	4 	2 	who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.
Psa 	53 	5 	1 	There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.
Psa 	53 	6 	1 	Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!
Psa 	53 	6 	2 	When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
Psa 	54 	1 	1 	Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
Psa 	54 	2 	1 	Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
Psa 	54 	3 	1 	For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them.
Psa 	54 	3 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	54 	4 	1 	Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
Psa 	54 	5 	1 	He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.
Psa 	54 	6 	1 	I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good.
Psa 	54 	7 	1 	For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
Psa 	55 	1 	1 	Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.
Psa 	55 	2 	1 	Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
Psa 	55 	3 	1 	Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
Psa 	55 	4 	1 	My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
Psa 	55 	5 	1 	Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.
Psa 	55 	6 	1 	And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove!
Psa 	55 	6 	2 	for then would I fly away, and be at rest.
Psa 	55 	7 	1 	Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.
Psa 	55 	7 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	55 	8 	1 	I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.
Psa 	55 	9 	1 	Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
Psa 	55 	10 	1 	Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.
Psa 	55 	11 	1 	Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.
Psa 	55 	12 	1 	For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:
Psa 	55 	13 	1 	But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.
Psa 	55 	14 	1 	We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.
Psa 	55 	15 	1 	Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
Psa 	55 	16 	1 	As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.
Psa 	55 	17 	1 	Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.
Psa 	55 	18 	1 	He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.
Psa 	55 	19 	1 	God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.
Psa 	55 	19 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	55 	19 	3 	Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
Psa 	55 	20 	1 	He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.
Psa 	55 	21 	1 	The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.
Psa 	55 	22 	1 	Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
Psa 	55 	23 	1 	But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
Psa 	56 	1 	1 	Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.
Psa 	56 	2 	1 	Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High.
Psa 	56 	3 	1 	What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
Psa 	56 	4 	1 	In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
Psa 	56 	5 	1 	Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.
Psa 	56 	6 	1 	They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.
Psa 	56 	7 	1 	Shall they escape by iniquity?
Psa 	56 	7 	2 	in thine anger cast down the people, O God.
Psa 	56 	8 	1 	Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?
Psa 	56 	9 	1 	When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me.
Psa 	56 	10 	1 	In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word.
Psa 	56 	11 	1 	In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
Psa 	56 	12 	1 	Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.
Psa 	56 	13 	1 	For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
Psa 	57 	1 	1 	Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.
Psa 	57 	2 	1 	I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.
Psa 	57 	3 	1 	He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up.
Psa 	57 	3 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	57 	3 	3 	God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.
Psa 	57 	4 	1 	My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Psa 	57 	5 	1 	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.
Psa 	57 	6 	1 	They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves.
Psa 	57 	6 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	57 	7 	1 	My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.
Psa 	57 	8 	1 	Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
Psa 	57 	9 	1 	I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.
Psa 	57 	10 	1 	For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.
Psa 	57 	11 	1 	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.
Psa 	58 	1 	1 	Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation?
Psa 	58 	1 	2 	do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
Psa 	58 	2 	1 	Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
Psa 	58 	3 	1 	The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.
Psa 	58 	4 	1 	Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;
Psa 	58 	5 	1 	Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
Psa 	58 	6 	1 	Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.
Psa 	58 	7 	1 	Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
Psa 	58 	8 	1 	As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.
Psa 	58 	9 	1 	Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.
Psa 	58 	10 	1 	The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
Psa 	58 	11 	1 	So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
Psa 	59 	1 	1 	Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.
Psa 	59 	2 	1 	Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
Psa 	59 	3 	1 	For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.
Psa 	59 	4 	1 	They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.
Psa 	59 	5 	1 	Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors.
Psa 	59 	5 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	59 	6 	1 	They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
Psa 	59 	7 	1 	Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?
Psa 	59 	8 	1 	But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.
Psa 	59 	9 	1 	Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.
Psa 	59 	10 	1 	The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.
Psa 	59 	11 	1 	Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
Psa 	59 	12 	1 	For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.
Psa 	59 	13 	1 	Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth.
Psa 	59 	13 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	59 	14 	1 	And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
Psa 	59 	15 	1 	Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.
Psa 	59 	16 	1 	But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.
Psa 	59 	17 	1 	Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.
Psa 	60 	1 	1 	O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.
Psa 	60 	2 	1 	Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
Psa 	60 	3 	1 	Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.
Psa 	60 	4 	1 	Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth.
Psa 	60 	4 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	60 	5 	1 	That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.
Psa 	60 	6 	1 	God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Psa 	60 	7 	1 	Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
Psa 	60 	8 	1 	Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.
Psa 	60 	9 	1 	Who will bring me into the strong city?
Psa 	60 	9 	2 	who will lead me into Edom?
Psa 	60 	10 	1 	Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off?
Psa 	60 	10 	2 	and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?
Psa 	60 	11 	1 	Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Psa 	60 	12 	1 	Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
Psa 	61 	1 	1 	Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
Psa 	61 	2 	1 	From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
Psa 	61 	3 	1 	For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.
Psa 	61 	4 	1 	I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings.
Psa 	61 	4 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	61 	5 	1 	For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.
Psa 	61 	6 	1 	Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.
Psa 	61 	7 	1 	He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.
Psa 	61 	8 	1 	So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
Psa 	62 	1 	1 	Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.
Psa 	62 	2 	1 	He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
Psa 	62 	3 	1 	How long will ye imagine mischief against a man?
Psa 	62 	3 	2 	ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.
Psa 	62 	4 	1 	They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.
Psa 	62 	4 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	62 	5 	1 	My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.
Psa 	62 	6 	1 	He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.
Psa 	62 	7 	1 	In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
Psa 	62 	8 	1 	Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us.
Psa 	62 	8 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	62 	9 	1 	Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.
Psa 	62 	10 	1 	Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.
Psa 	62 	11 	1 	God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.
Psa 	62 	12 	1 	Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
Psa 	63 	1 	1 	O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;
Psa 	63 	2 	1 	To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
Psa 	63 	3 	1 	Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
Psa 	63 	4 	1 	Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.
Psa 	63 	5 	1 	My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:
Psa 	63 	6 	1 	When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.
Psa 	63 	7 	1 	Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
Psa 	63 	8 	1 	My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.
Psa 	63 	9 	1 	But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
Psa 	63 	10 	1 	They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.
Psa 	63 	11 	1 	But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
Psa 	64 	1 	1 	Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Psa 	64 	2 	1 	Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:
Psa 	64 	3 	1 	Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:
Psa 	64 	4 	1 	That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
Psa 	64 	5 	1 	They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?
Psa 	64 	6 	1 	They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.
Psa 	64 	7 	1 	But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.
Psa 	64 	8 	1 	So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.
Psa 	64 	9 	1 	And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.
Psa 	64 	10 	1 	The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
Psa 	65 	1 	1 	raise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.
Psa 	65 	2 	1 	O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
Psa 	65 	3 	1 	Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.
Psa 	65 	4 	1 	Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.
Psa 	65 	5 	1 	By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:
Psa 	65 	6 	1 	Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power:
Psa 	65 	7 	1 	Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.
Psa 	65 	8 	1 	They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
Psa 	65 	9 	1 	Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.
Psa 	65 	10 	1 	Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.
Psa 	65 	11 	1 	Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.
Psa 	65 	12 	1 	They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.
Psa 	65 	13 	1 	The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
Psa 	66 	1 	1 	Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:
Psa 	66 	2 	1 	Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.
Psa 	66 	3 	1 	Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works!
Psa 	66 	3 	2 	through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
Psa 	66 	4 	1 	All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name.
Psa 	66 	4 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	66 	5 	1 	Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
Psa 	66 	6 	1 	He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
Psa 	66 	7 	1 	He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves.
Psa 	66 	7 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	66 	8 	1 	O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:
Psa 	66 	9 	1 	Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.
Psa 	66 	10 	1 	For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
Psa 	66 	11 	1 	Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.
Psa 	66 	12 	1 	Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
Psa 	66 	13 	1 	I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,
Psa 	66 	14 	1 	Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.
Psa 	66 	15 	1 	I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats.
Psa 	66 	15 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	66 	16 	1 	Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
Psa 	66 	17 	1 	I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
Psa 	66 	18 	1 	If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:
Psa 	66 	19 	1 	But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
Psa 	66 	20 	1 	Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
Psa 	67 	1 	1 	God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah.
Psa 	67 	2 	1 	That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.
Psa 	67 	3 	1 	Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
Psa 	67 	4 	1 	O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.
Psa 	67 	4 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	67 	5 	1 	Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
Psa 	67 	6 	1 	Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.
Psa 	67 	7 	1 	God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
Psa 	68 	1 	1 	Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.
Psa 	68 	2 	1 	As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
Psa 	68 	3 	1 	But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.
Psa 	68 	4 	1 	Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.
Psa 	68 	5 	1 	A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.
Psa 	68 	6 	1 	God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.
Psa 	68 	7 	1 	O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:
Psa 	68 	8 	1 	The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
Psa 	68 	9 	1 	Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.
Psa 	68 	10 	1 	Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.
Psa 	68 	11 	1 	The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.
Psa 	68 	12 	1 	Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.
Psa 	68 	13 	1 	Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.
Psa 	68 	14 	1 	When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon.
Psa 	68 	15 	1 	The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.
Psa 	68 	16 	1 	Why leap ye, ye high hills?
Psa 	68 	16 	2 	this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.
Psa 	68 	17 	1 	The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.
Psa 	68 	18 	1 	Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.
Psa 	68 	19 	1 	Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation.
Psa 	68 	19 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	68 	20 	1 	He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death.
Psa 	68 	21 	1 	But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.
Psa 	68 	22 	1 	The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:
Psa 	68 	23 	1 	That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.
Psa 	68 	24 	1 	They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.
Psa 	68 	25 	1 	The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.
Psa 	68 	26 	1 	Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.
Psa 	68 	27 	1 	There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.
Psa 	68 	28 	1 	Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.
Psa 	68 	29 	1 	Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.
Psa 	68 	30 	1 	Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war.
Psa 	68 	31 	1 	rinces shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.
Psa 	68 	32 	1 	Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:
Psa 	68 	33 	1 	To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.
Psa 	68 	34 	1 	Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.
Psa 	68 	35 	1 	O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people.
Psa 	68 	35 	2 	Blessed be God.
Psa 	69 	1 	1 	Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.
Psa 	69 	2 	1 	I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
Psa 	69 	3 	1 	I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
Psa 	69 	4 	1 	They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.
Psa 	69 	5 	1 	O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.
Psa 	69 	6 	1 	Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
Psa 	69 	7 	1 	Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
Psa 	69 	8 	1 	I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.
Psa 	69 	9 	1 	For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
Psa 	69 	10 	1 	When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.
Psa 	69 	11 	1 	I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
Psa 	69 	12 	1 	They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.
Psa 	69 	13 	1 	But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.
Psa 	69 	14 	1 	Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Psa 	69 	15 	1 	Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Psa 	69 	16 	1 	Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
Psa 	69 	17 	1 	And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.
Psa 	69 	18 	1 	Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.
Psa 	69 	19 	1 	Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.
Psa 	69 	20 	1 	Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.
Psa 	69 	21 	1 	They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
Psa 	69 	22 	1 	Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.
Psa 	69 	23 	1 	Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.
Psa 	69 	24 	1 	our out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
Psa 	69 	25 	1 	Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.
Psa 	69 	26 	1 	For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
Psa 	69 	27 	1 	Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.
Psa 	69 	28 	1 	Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.
Psa 	69 	29 	1 	But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
Psa 	69 	30 	1 	I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
Psa 	69 	31 	1 	This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
Psa 	69 	32 	1 	The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.
Psa 	69 	33 	1 	For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.
Psa 	69 	34 	1 	Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.
Psa 	69 	35 	1 	For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.
Psa 	69 	36 	1 	The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
Psa 	70 	1 	1 	MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD.
Psa 	70 	2 	1 	Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
Psa 	70 	3 	1 	Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
Psa 	70 	4 	1 	Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
Psa 	70 	5 	1 	But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
Psa 	71 	1 	1 	In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.
Psa 	71 	2 	1 	Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
Psa 	71 	3 	1 	Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.
Psa 	71 	4 	1 	Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
Psa 	71 	5 	1 	For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth.
Psa 	71 	6 	1 	By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.
Psa 	71 	7 	1 	I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.
Psa 	71 	8 	1 	Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.
Psa 	71 	9 	1 	Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.
Psa 	71 	10 	1 	For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,
Psa 	71 	11 	1 	Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.
Psa 	71 	12 	1 	O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.
Psa 	71 	13 	1 	Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.
Psa 	71 	14 	1 	But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.
Psa 	71 	15 	1 	My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.
Psa 	71 	16 	1 	I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
Psa 	71 	17 	1 	O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
Psa 	71 	18 	1 	Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.
Psa 	71 	19 	1 	Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!
Psa 	71 	20 	1 	Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
Psa 	71 	21 	1 	Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
Psa 	71 	22 	1 	I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.
Psa 	71 	23 	1 	My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
Psa 	71 	24 	1 	My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.
Psa 	72 	1 	1 	Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.
Psa 	72 	2 	1 	He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.
Psa 	72 	3 	1 	The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.
Psa 	72 	4 	1 	He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
Psa 	72 	5 	1 	They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.
Psa 	72 	6 	1 	He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.
Psa 	72 	7 	1 	In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.
Psa 	72 	8 	1 	He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
Psa 	72 	9 	1 	They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
Psa 	72 	10 	1 	The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
Psa 	72 	11 	1 	Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.
Psa 	72 	12 	1 	For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.
Psa 	72 	13 	1 	He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.
Psa 	72 	14 	1 	He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.
Psa 	72 	15 	1 	And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.
Psa 	72 	16 	1 	There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
Psa 	72 	17 	1 	His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.
Psa 	72 	18 	1 	Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.
Psa 	72 	19 	1 	And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.
Psa 	72 	20 	1 	The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
Psa 	73 	1 	1 	Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.
Psa 	73 	2 	1 	But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.
Psa 	73 	3 	1 	For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
Psa 	73 	4 	1 	For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.
Psa 	73 	5 	1 	They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.
Psa 	73 	6 	1 	Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.
Psa 	73 	7 	1 	Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.
Psa 	73 	8 	1 	They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.
Psa 	73 	9 	1 	They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.
Psa 	73 	10 	1 	Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.
Psa 	73 	11 	1 	And they say, How doth God know?
Psa 	73 	11 	2 	and is there knowledge in the most High?
Psa 	73 	12 	1 	Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.
Psa 	73 	13 	1 	Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.
Psa 	73 	14 	1 	For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.
Psa 	73 	15 	1 	If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.
Psa 	73 	16 	1 	When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
Psa 	73 	17 	1 	Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.
Psa 	73 	18 	1 	Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.
Psa 	73 	19 	1 	How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment!
Psa 	73 	19 	2 	they are utterly consumed with terrors.
Psa 	73 	20 	1 	As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.
Psa 	73 	21 	1 	Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
Psa 	73 	22 	1 	So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.
Psa 	73 	23 	1 	Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.
Psa 	73 	24 	1 	Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.
Psa 	73 	25 	1 	Whom have I in heaven but thee?
Psa 	73 	25 	2 	and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.
Psa 	73 	26 	1 	My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
Psa 	73 	27 	1 	For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
Psa 	73 	28 	1 	But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
Psa 	74 	1 	1 	O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever?
Psa 	74 	1 	2 	why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
Psa 	74 	2 	1 	Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
Psa 	74 	3 	1 	Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
Psa 	74 	4 	1 	Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.
Psa 	74 	5 	1 	A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.
Psa 	74 	6 	1 	But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.
Psa 	74 	7 	1 	They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.
Psa 	74 	8 	1 	They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
Psa 	74 	9 	1 	We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
Psa 	74 	10 	1 	O God, how long shall the adversary reproach?
Psa 	74 	10 	2 	shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
Psa 	74 	11 	1 	Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand?
Psa 	74 	11 	2 	pluck it out of thy bosom.
Psa 	74 	12 	1 	For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
Psa 	74 	13 	1 	Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.
Psa 	74 	14 	1 	Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
Psa 	74 	15 	1 	Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.
Psa 	74 	16 	1 	The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Psa 	74 	17 	1 	Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
Psa 	74 	18 	1 	Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
Psa 	74 	19 	1 	O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
Psa 	74 	20 	1 	Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
Psa 	74 	21 	1 	O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.
Psa 	74 	22 	1 	Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.
Psa 	74 	23 	1 	Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
Psa 	75 	1 	1 	Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.
Psa 	75 	2 	1 	When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
Psa 	75 	3 	1 	The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it.
Psa 	75 	3 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	75 	4 	1 	I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
Psa 	75 	5 	1 	Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.
Psa 	75 	6 	1 	For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
Psa 	75 	7 	1 	But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
Psa 	75 	8 	1 	For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.
Psa 	75 	9 	1 	But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
Psa 	75 	10 	1 	All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
Psa 	76 	1 	1 	In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.
Psa 	76 	2 	1 	In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.
Psa 	76 	3 	1 	There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle.
Psa 	76 	3 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	76 	4 	1 	Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
Psa 	76 	5 	1 	The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.
Psa 	76 	6 	1 	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
Psa 	76 	7 	1 	Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
Psa 	76 	8 	1 	Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,
Psa 	76 	9 	1 	When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
Psa 	76 	9 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	76 	10 	1 	Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
Psa 	76 	11 	1 	Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
Psa 	76 	12 	1 	He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
Psa 	77 	1 	1 	I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.
Psa 	77 	2 	1 	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
Psa 	77 	3 	1 	I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed.
Psa 	77 	3 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	77 	4 	1 	Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
Psa 	77 	5 	1 	I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
Psa 	77 	6 	1 	I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
Psa 	77 	7 	1 	Will the Lord cast off for ever?
Psa 	77 	7 	2 	and will he be favourable no more?
Psa 	77 	8 	1 	Is his mercy clean gone for ever?
Psa 	77 	8 	2 	doth his promise fail for evermore?
Psa 	77 	9 	1 	Hath God forgotten to be gracious?
Psa 	77 	9 	2 	hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?
Psa 	77 	9 	3 	Selah.
Psa 	77 	10 	1 	And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.
Psa 	77 	11 	1 	I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
Psa 	77 	12 	1 	I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
Psa 	77 	13 	1 	Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?
Psa 	77 	14 	1 	Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
Psa 	77 	15 	1 	Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
Psa 	77 	15 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	77 	16 	1 	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.
Psa 	77 	17 	1 	The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.
Psa 	77 	18 	1 	The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
Psa 	77 	19 	1 	Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
Psa 	77 	20 	1 	Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Psa 	78 	1 	1 	Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
Psa 	78 	2 	1 	I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
Psa 	78 	3 	1 	Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
Psa 	78 	4 	1 	We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
Psa 	78 	5 	1 	For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
Psa 	78 	6 	1 	That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:
Psa 	78 	7 	1 	That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
Psa 	78 	8 	1 	And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
Psa 	78 	9 	1 	The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
Psa 	78 	10 	1 	They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
Psa 	78 	11 	1 	And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
Psa 	78 	12 	1 	Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
Psa 	78 	13 	1 	He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
Psa 	78 	14 	1 	In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
Psa 	78 	15 	1 	He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
Psa 	78 	16 	1 	He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
Psa 	78 	17 	1 	And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
Psa 	78 	18 	1 	And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
Psa 	78 	19 	1 	Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
Psa 	78 	20 	1 	Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also?
Psa 	78 	20 	2 	can he provide flesh for his people?
Psa 	78 	21 	1 	Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
Psa 	78 	22 	1 	Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
Psa 	78 	23 	1 	Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
Psa 	78 	24 	1 	And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
Psa 	78 	25 	1 	Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
Psa 	78 	26 	1 	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
Psa 	78 	27 	1 	He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
Psa 	78 	28 	1 	And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
Psa 	78 	29 	1 	So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
Psa 	78 	30 	1 	They were not estranged from their lust.
Psa 	78 	30 	2 	But while their meat was yet in their mouths,
Psa 	78 	31 	1 	The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
Psa 	78 	32 	1 	For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
Psa 	78 	33 	1 	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
Psa 	78 	34 	1 	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
Psa 	78 	35 	1 	And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
Psa 	78 	36 	1 	Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
Psa 	78 	37 	1 	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
Psa 	78 	38 	1 	But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
Psa 	78 	39 	1 	For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
Psa 	78 	40 	1 	How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
Psa 	78 	41 	1 	Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
Psa 	78 	42 	1 	They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
Psa 	78 	43 	1 	How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
Psa 	78 	44 	1 	And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
Psa 	78 	45 	1 	He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
Psa 	78 	46 	1 	He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
Psa 	78 	47 	1 	He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
Psa 	78 	48 	1 	He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
Psa 	78 	49 	1 	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
Psa 	78 	50 	1 	He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
Psa 	78 	51 	1 	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
Psa 	78 	52 	1 	But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
Psa 	78 	53 	1 	And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
Psa 	78 	54 	1 	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
Psa 	78 	55 	1 	He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Psa 	78 	56 	1 	Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
Psa 	78 	57 	1 	But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
Psa 	78 	58 	1 	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
Psa 	78 	59 	1 	When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
Psa 	78 	60 	1 	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
Psa 	78 	61 	1 	And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
Psa 	78 	62 	1 	He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
Psa 	78 	63 	1 	The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
Psa 	78 	64 	1 	Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
Psa 	78 	65 	1 	Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
Psa 	78 	66 	1 	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
Psa 	78 	67 	1 	Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
Psa 	78 	68 	1 	But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
Psa 	78 	69 	1 	And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
Psa 	78 	70 	1 	He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
Psa 	78 	71 	1 	From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
Psa 	78 	72 	1 	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
Psa 	79 	1 	1 	O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
Psa 	79 	2 	1 	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
Psa 	79 	3 	1 	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.
Psa 	79 	4 	1 	We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
Psa 	79 	5 	1 	How long, LORD?
Psa 	79 	5 	2 	wilt thou be angry for ever?
Psa 	79 	5 	3 	shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
Psa 	79 	6 	1 	our out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
Psa 	79 	7 	1 	For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
Psa 	79 	8 	1 	O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
Psa 	79 	9 	1 	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
Psa 	79 	10 	1 	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God?
Psa 	79 	10 	2 	let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed.
Psa 	79 	11 	1 	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
Psa 	79 	12 	1 	And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
Psa 	79 	13 	1 	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
Psa 	80 	1 	1 	Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.
Psa 	80 	2 	1 	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.
Psa 	80 	3 	1 	Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Psa 	80 	4 	1 	O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
Psa 	80 	5 	1 	Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
Psa 	80 	6 	1 	Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
Psa 	80 	7 	1 	Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Psa 	80 	8 	1 	Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
Psa 	80 	9 	1 	Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
Psa 	80 	10 	1 	The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.
Psa 	80 	11 	1 	She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.
Psa 	80 	12 	1 	Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
Psa 	80 	13 	1 	The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
Psa 	80 	14 	1 	Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
Psa 	80 	15 	1 	And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
Psa 	80 	16 	1 	It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
Psa 	80 	17 	1 	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
Psa 	80 	18 	1 	So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
Psa 	80 	19 	1 	Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Psa 	81 	1 	1 	Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
Psa 	81 	2 	1 	Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
Psa 	81 	3 	1 	Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
Psa 	81 	4 	1 	For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.
Psa 	81 	5 	1 	This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.
Psa 	81 	6 	1 	I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.
Psa 	81 	7 	1 	Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah.
Psa 	81 	7 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	81 	8 	1 	Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;
Psa 	81 	9 	1 	There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
Psa 	81 	10 	1 	I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
Psa 	81 	11 	1 	But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.
Psa 	81 	12 	1 	So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.
Psa 	81 	13 	1 	Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!
Psa 	81 	14 	1 	I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
Psa 	81 	15 	1 	The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.
Psa 	81 	16 	1 	He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
Psa 	82 	1 	1 	God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
Psa 	82 	2 	1 	How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked?
Psa 	82 	2 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	82 	3 	1 	Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
Psa 	82 	4 	1 	Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
Psa 	82 	5 	1 	They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
Psa 	82 	6 	1 	I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
Psa 	82 	7 	1 	But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
Psa 	82 	8 	1 	Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
Psa 	83 	1 	1 	Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
Psa 	83 	2 	1 	For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
Psa 	83 	3 	1 	They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
Psa 	83 	4 	1 	They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
Psa 	83 	5 	1 	For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:
Psa 	83 	6 	1 	The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;
Psa 	83 	7 	1 	Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Psa 	83 	8 	1 	Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot.
Psa 	83 	8 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	83 	9 	1 	Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:
Psa 	83 	10 	1 	Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.
Psa 	83 	11 	1 	Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
Psa 	83 	12 	1 	Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.
Psa 	83 	13 	1 	O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.
Psa 	83 	14 	1 	As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;
Psa 	83 	15 	1 	So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.
Psa 	83 	16 	1 	Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.
Psa 	83 	17 	1 	Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
Psa 	83 	18 	1 	That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.
Psa 	84 	1 	1 	How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
Psa 	84 	2 	1 	My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
Psa 	84 	3 	1 	Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.
Psa 	84 	4 	1 	Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee.
Psa 	84 	4 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	84 	5 	1 	Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.
Psa 	84 	6 	1 	Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.
Psa 	84 	7 	1 	They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.
Psa 	84 	8 	1 	O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.
Psa 	84 	8 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	84 	9 	1 	Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
Psa 	84 	10 	1 	For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand.
Psa 	84 	10 	2 	I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
Psa 	84 	11 	1 	For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
Psa 	84 	12 	1 	O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
Psa 	85 	1 	1 	Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
Psa 	85 	2 	1 	Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin.
Psa 	85 	2 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	85 	3 	1 	Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.
Psa 	85 	4 	1 	Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.
Psa 	85 	5 	1 	Wilt thou be angry with us for ever?
Psa 	85 	5 	2 	wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
Psa 	85 	6 	1 	Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Psa 	85 	7 	1 	Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.
Psa 	85 	8 	1 	I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.
Psa 	85 	9 	1 	Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.
Psa 	85 	10 	1 	Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Psa 	85 	11 	1 	Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
Psa 	85 	12 	1 	Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.
Psa 	85 	13 	1 	Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.
Psa 	86 	1 	1 	Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.
Psa 	86 	2 	1 	reserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
Psa 	86 	3 	1 	Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
Psa 	86 	4 	1 	Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
Psa 	86 	5 	1 	For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
Psa 	86 	6 	1 	Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.
Psa 	86 	7 	1 	In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.
Psa 	86 	8 	1 	Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.
Psa 	86 	9 	1 	All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
Psa 	86 	10 	1 	For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
Psa 	86 	11 	1 	Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.
Psa 	86 	12 	1 	I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
Psa 	86 	13 	1 	For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
Psa 	86 	14 	1 	O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.
Psa 	86 	15 	1 	But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, long suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
Psa 	86 	16 	1 	O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
Psa 	86 	17 	1 	Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
Psa 	87 	1 	1 	His foundation is in the holy mountains.
Psa 	87 	2 	1 	The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Psa 	87 	3 	1 	Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God.
Psa 	87 	3 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	87 	4 	1 	I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.
Psa 	87 	5 	1 	And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.
Psa 	87 	6 	1 	The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there.
Psa 	87 	6 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	87 	7 	1 	As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.
Psa 	88 	1 	1 	O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:
Psa 	88 	2 	1 	Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
Psa 	88 	3 	1 	For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
Psa 	88 	4 	1 	I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength:
Psa 	88 	5 	1 	Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
Psa 	88 	6 	1 	Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
Psa 	88 	7 	1 	Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves.
Psa 	88 	7 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	88 	8 	1 	Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
Psa 	88 	9 	1 	Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
Psa 	88 	10 	1 	Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead?
Psa 	88 	10 	2 	shall the dead arise and praise thee?
Psa 	88 	10 	3 	Selah.
Psa 	88 	11 	1 	Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave?
Psa 	88 	11 	2 	or thy faithfulness in destruction?
Psa 	88 	12 	1 	Shall thy wonders be known in the dark?
Psa 	88 	12 	2 	and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
Psa 	88 	13 	1 	But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.
Psa 	88 	14 	1 	LORD, why castest thou off my soul?
Psa 	88 	14 	2 	why hidest thou thy face from me?
Psa 	88 	15 	1 	I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
Psa 	88 	16 	1 	Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
Psa 	88 	17 	1 	They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.
Psa 	88 	18 	1 	Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.
Psa 	89 	1 	1 	I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
Psa 	89 	2 	1 	For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.
Psa 	89 	3 	1 	I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,
Psa 	89 	4 	1 	Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations.
Psa 	89 	4 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	89 	5 	1 	And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.
Psa 	89 	6 	1 	For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD?
Psa 	89 	6 	2 	who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?
Psa 	89 	7 	1 	God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.
Psa 	89 	8 	1 	O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee?
Psa 	89 	8 	2 	or to thy faithfulness round about thee?
Psa 	89 	9 	1 	Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
Psa 	89 	10 	1 	Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
Psa 	89 	11 	1 	The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
Psa 	89 	12 	1 	The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
Psa 	89 	13 	1 	Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
Psa 	89 	14 	1 	Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
Psa 	89 	15 	1 	Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.
Psa 	89 	16 	1 	In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
Psa 	89 	17 	1 	For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
Psa 	89 	18 	1 	For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.
Psa 	89 	19 	1 	Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
Psa 	89 	20 	1 	I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:
Psa 	89 	21 	1 	With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.
Psa 	89 	22 	1 	The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
Psa 	89 	23 	1 	And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.
Psa 	89 	24 	1 	But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
Psa 	89 	25 	1 	I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
Psa 	89 	26 	1 	He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.
Psa 	89 	27 	1 	Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.
Psa 	89 	28 	1 	My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
Psa 	89 	29 	1 	His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.
Psa 	89 	30 	1 	If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
Psa 	89 	31 	1 	If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
Psa 	89 	32 	1 	Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.
Psa 	89 	33 	1 	Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
Psa 	89 	34 	1 	My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
Psa 	89 	35 	1 	Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
Psa 	89 	36 	1 	His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.
Psa 	89 	37 	1 	It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven.
Psa 	89 	37 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	89 	38 	1 	But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
Psa 	89 	39 	1 	Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
Psa 	89 	40 	1 	Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.
Psa 	89 	41 	1 	All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.
Psa 	89 	42 	1 	Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
Psa 	89 	43 	1 	Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.
Psa 	89 	44 	1 	Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.
Psa 	89 	45 	1 	The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame.
Psa 	89 	45 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	89 	46 	1 	How long, LORD?
Psa 	89 	46 	2 	wilt thou hide thyself for ever?
Psa 	89 	46 	3 	shall thy wrath burn like fire?
Psa 	89 	47 	1 	Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?
Psa 	89 	48 	1 	What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?
Psa 	89 	48 	2 	shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?
Psa 	89 	48 	3 	Selah.
Psa 	89 	49 	1 	Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?
Psa 	89 	50 	1 	Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;
Psa 	89 	51 	1 	Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
Psa 	89 	52 	1 	Blessed be the LORD for evermore.
Psa 	89 	52 	2 	Amen, and Amen.
Psa 	90 	1 	1 	Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
Psa 	90 	2 	1 	Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
Psa 	90 	3 	1 	Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.
Psa 	90 	4 	1 	For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.
Psa 	90 	5 	1 	Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
Psa 	90 	6 	1 	In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
Psa 	90 	7 	1 	For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.
Psa 	90 	8 	1 	Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
Psa 	90 	9 	1 	For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.
Psa 	90 	10 	1 	The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
Psa 	90 	11 	1 	Who knoweth the power of thine anger?
Psa 	90 	11 	2 	even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.
Psa 	90 	12 	1 	So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Psa 	90 	13 	1 	Return, O LORD, how long?
Psa 	90 	13 	2 	and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
Psa 	90 	14 	1 	O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
Psa 	90 	15 	1 	Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.
Psa 	90 	16 	1 	Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.
Psa 	90 	17 	1 	And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
Psa 	91 	1 	1 	He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
Psa 	91 	2 	1 	I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.
Psa 	91 	3 	1 	Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.
Psa 	91 	4 	1 	He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Psa 	91 	5 	1 	Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
Psa 	91 	6 	1 	Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
Psa 	91 	7 	1 	A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
Psa 	91 	8 	1 	Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
Psa 	91 	9 	1 	Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;
Psa 	91 	10 	1 	There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
Psa 	91 	11 	1 	For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
Psa 	91 	12 	1 	They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Psa 	91 	13 	1 	Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
Psa 	91 	14 	1 	Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
Psa 	91 	15 	1 	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
Psa 	91 	16 	1 	With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
Psa 	92 	1 	1 	IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:
Psa 	92 	2 	1 	To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
Psa 	92 	3 	1 	Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.
Psa 	92 	4 	1 	For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
Psa 	92 	5 	1 	O LORD, how great are thy works!
Psa 	92 	5 	2 	and thy thoughts are very deep.
Psa 	92 	6 	1 	A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
Psa 	92 	7 	1 	When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:
Psa 	92 	8 	1 	But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.
Psa 	92 	9 	1 	For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
Psa 	92 	10 	1 	But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
Psa 	92 	11 	1 	Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.
Psa 	92 	12 	1 	The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
Psa 	92 	13 	1 	Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.
Psa 	92 	14 	1 	They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;
Psa 	92 	15 	1 	To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
Psa 	93 	1 	1 	The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
Psa 	93 	2 	1 	Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.
Psa 	93 	3 	1 	The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.
Psa 	93 	4 	1 	The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.
Psa 	93 	5 	1 	Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.
Psa 	94 	1 	1 	O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.
Psa 	94 	2 	1 	Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.
Psa 	94 	3 	1 	LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
Psa 	94 	4 	1 	How long shall they utter and speak hard things?
Psa 	94 	4 	2 	and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
Psa 	94 	5 	1 	They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.
Psa 	94 	6 	1 	They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.
Psa 	94 	7 	1 	Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.
Psa 	94 	8 	1 	Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?
Psa 	94 	9 	1 	He that planted the ear, shall he not hear?
Psa 	94 	9 	2 	he that formed the eye, shall he not see?
Psa 	94 	10 	1 	He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct?
Psa 	94 	10 	2 	he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?
Psa 	94 	11 	1 	The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
Psa 	94 	12 	1 	Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;
Psa 	94 	13 	1 	That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.
Psa 	94 	14 	1 	For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.
Psa 	94 	15 	1 	But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
Psa 	94 	16 	1 	Who will rise up for me against the evildoers?
Psa 	94 	16 	2 	or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
Psa 	94 	17 	1 	Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.
Psa 	94 	18 	1 	When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
Psa 	94 	19 	1 	In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.
Psa 	94 	20 	1 	Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?
Psa 	94 	21 	1 	They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
Psa 	94 	22 	1 	But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.
Psa 	94 	23 	1 	And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.
Psa 	95 	1 	1 	O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
Psa 	95 	2 	1 	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
Psa 	95 	3 	1 	For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
Psa 	95 	4 	1 	In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.
Psa 	95 	5 	1 	The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.
Psa 	95 	6 	1 	O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.
Psa 	95 	7 	1 	For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.
Psa 	95 	7 	2 	To day if ye will hear his voice,
Psa 	95 	8 	1 	Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
Psa 	95 	9 	1 	When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
Psa 	95 	10 	1 	Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:
Psa 	95 	11 	1 	Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
Psa 	96 	1 	1 	O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.
Psa 	96 	2 	1 	Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.
Psa 	96 	3 	1 	Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
Psa 	96 	4 	1 	For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.
Psa 	96 	5 	1 	For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.
Psa 	96 	6 	1 	Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
Psa 	96 	7 	1 	Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.
Psa 	96 	8 	1 	Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.
Psa 	96 	9 	1 	O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.
Psa 	96 	10 	1 	Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.
Psa 	96 	11 	1 	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.
Psa 	96 	12 	1 	Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
Psa 	96 	13 	1 	Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
Psa 	97 	1 	1 	The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.
Psa 	97 	2 	1 	Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.
Psa 	97 	3 	1 	A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.
Psa 	97 	4 	1 	His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.
Psa 	97 	5 	1 	The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
Psa 	97 	6 	1 	The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.
Psa 	97 	7 	1 	Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.
Psa 	97 	8 	1 	Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.
Psa 	97 	9 	1 	For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.
Psa 	97 	10 	1 	Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.
Psa 	97 	11 	1 	Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
Psa 	97 	12 	1 	Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
Psa 	98 	1 	1 	O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.
Psa 	98 	2 	1 	The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.
Psa 	98 	3 	1 	He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Psa 	98 	4 	1 	Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.
Psa 	98 	5 	1 	Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.
Psa 	98 	6 	1 	With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.
Psa 	98 	7 	1 	Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
Psa 	98 	8 	1 	Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together
Psa 	98 	9 	1 	Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.
Psa 	99 	1 	1 	The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.
Psa 	99 	2 	1 	The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.
Psa 	99 	3 	1 	Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.
Psa 	99 	4 	1 	The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
Psa 	99 	5 	1 	Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.
Psa 	99 	6 	1 	Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.
Psa 	99 	7 	1 	He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.
Psa 	99 	8 	1 	Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.
Psa 	99 	9 	1 	Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.
Psa 	100 	1 	1 	Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.
Psa 	100 	2 	1 	Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.
Psa 	100 	3 	1 	Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
Psa 	100 	4 	1 	Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.
Psa 	100 	5 	1 	For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.
Psa 	101 	1 	1 	I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.
Psa 	101 	2 	1 	I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way.
Psa 	101 	2 	2 	O when wilt thou come unto me?
Psa 	101 	2 	3 	I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
Psa 	101 	3 	1 	I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.
Psa 	101 	4 	1 	A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
Psa 	101 	5 	1 	Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.
Psa 	101 	6 	1 	Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
Psa 	101 	7 	1 	He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.
Psa 	101 	8 	1 	I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.
Psa 	102 	1 	1 	Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.
Psa 	102 	2 	1 	Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.
Psa 	102 	3 	1 	For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.
Psa 	102 	4 	1 	My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.
Psa 	102 	5 	1 	By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.
Psa 	102 	6 	1 	I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.
Psa 	102 	7 	1 	I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
Psa 	102 	8 	1 	Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.
Psa 	102 	9 	1 	For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.
Psa 	102 	10 	1 	Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.
Psa 	102 	11 	1 	My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.
Psa 	102 	12 	1 	But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.
Psa 	102 	13 	1 	Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.
Psa 	102 	14 	1 	For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.
Psa 	102 	15 	1 	So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.
Psa 	102 	16 	1 	When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.
Psa 	102 	17 	1 	He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.
Psa 	102 	18 	1 	This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.
Psa 	102 	19 	1 	For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;
Psa 	102 	20 	1 	To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;
Psa 	102 	21 	1 	To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;
Psa 	102 	22 	1 	When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.
Psa 	102 	23 	1 	He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.
Psa 	102 	24 	1 	I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.
Psa 	102 	25 	1 	Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.
Psa 	102 	26 	1 	They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
Psa 	102 	27 	1 	But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.
Psa 	102 	28 	1 	The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
Psa 	103 	1 	1 	Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
Psa 	103 	2 	1 	Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
Psa 	103 	3 	1 	Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
Psa 	103 	4 	1 	Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
Psa 	103 	5 	1 	Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
Psa 	103 	6 	1 	The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.
Psa 	103 	7 	1 	He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
Psa 	103 	8 	1 	The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
Psa 	103 	9 	1 	He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.
Psa 	103 	10 	1 	He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
Psa 	103 	11 	1 	For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
Psa 	103 	12 	1 	As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
Psa 	103 	13 	1 	Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.
Psa 	103 	14 	1 	For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
Psa 	103 	15 	1 	As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
Psa 	103 	16 	1 	For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.
Psa 	103 	17 	1 	But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;
Psa 	103 	18 	1 	To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
Psa 	103 	19 	1 	The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.
Psa 	103 	20 	1 	Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
Psa 	103 	21 	1 	Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
Psa 	103 	22 	1 	Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.
Psa 	104 	1 	1 	Bless the LORD, O my soul.
Psa 	104 	1 	2 	O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.
Psa 	104 	2 	1 	Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
Psa 	104 	3 	1 	Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
Psa 	104 	4 	1 	Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
Psa 	104 	5 	1 	Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.
Psa 	104 	6 	1 	Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.
Psa 	104 	7 	1 	At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
Psa 	104 	8 	1 	They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
Psa 	104 	9 	1 	Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.
Psa 	104 	10 	1 	He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.
Psa 	104 	11 	1 	They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.
Psa 	104 	12 	1 	By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.
Psa 	104 	13 	1 	He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
Psa 	104 	14 	1 	He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
Psa 	104 	15 	1 	And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.
Psa 	104 	16 	1 	The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
Psa 	104 	17 	1 	Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
Psa 	104 	18 	1 	The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.
Psa 	104 	19 	1 	He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.
Psa 	104 	20 	1 	Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.
Psa 	104 	21 	1 	The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.
Psa 	104 	22 	1 	The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.
Psa 	104 	23 	1 	Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.
Psa 	104 	24 	1 	O LORD, how manifold are thy works!
Psa 	104 	24 	2 	in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.
Psa 	104 	25 	1 	So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.
Psa 	104 	26 	1 	There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.
Psa 	104 	27 	1 	These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.
Psa 	104 	28 	1 	That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
Psa 	104 	29 	1 	Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
Psa 	104 	30 	1 	Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.
Psa 	104 	31 	1 	The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.
Psa 	104 	32 	1 	He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
Psa 	104 	33 	1 	I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
Psa 	104 	34 	1 	My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.
Psa 	104 	35 	1 	Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more.
Psa 	104 	35 	2 	Bless thou the LORD, O my soul.
Psa 	104 	35 	3 	Praise ye the LORD.
Psa 	105 	1 	1 	O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.
Psa 	105 	2 	1 	Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.
Psa 	105 	3 	1 	Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
Psa 	105 	4 	1 	Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Psa 	105 	5 	1 	Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
Psa 	105 	6 	1 	O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.
Psa 	105 	7 	1 	He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
Psa 	105 	8 	1 	He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.
Psa 	105 	9 	1 	Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
Psa 	105 	10 	1 	And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:
Psa 	105 	11 	1 	Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:
Psa 	105 	12 	1 	When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.
Psa 	105 	13 	1 	When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;
Psa 	105 	14 	1 	He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
Psa 	105 	15 	1 	Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
Psa 	105 	16 	1 	Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.
Psa 	105 	17 	1 	He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:
Psa 	105 	18 	1 	Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
Psa 	105 	19 	1 	Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.
Psa 	105 	20 	1 	The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
Psa 	105 	21 	1 	He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
Psa 	105 	22 	1 	To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
Psa 	105 	23 	1 	Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
Psa 	105 	24 	1 	And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
Psa 	105 	25 	1 	He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.
Psa 	105 	26 	1 	He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
Psa 	105 	27 	1 	They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
Psa 	105 	28 	1 	He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
Psa 	105 	29 	1 	He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
Psa 	105 	30 	1 	Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
Psa 	105 	31 	1 	He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.
Psa 	105 	32 	1 	He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
Psa 	105 	33 	1 	He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.
Psa 	105 	34 	1 	He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,
Psa 	105 	35 	1 	And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
Psa 	105 	36 	1 	He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
Psa 	105 	37 	1 	He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
Psa 	105 	38 	1 	Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.
Psa 	105 	39 	1 	He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.
Psa 	105 	40 	1 	The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
Psa 	105 	41 	1 	He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.
Psa 	105 	42 	1 	For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.
Psa 	105 	43 	1 	And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:
Psa 	105 	44 	1 	And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;
Psa 	105 	45 	1 	That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws.
Psa 	105 	45 	2 	Praise ye the LORD.
Psa 	106 	1 	1 	raise ye the LORD.
Psa 	106 	1 	2 	O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	106 	2 	1 	Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD?
Psa 	106 	2 	2 	who can shew forth all his praise?
Psa 	106 	3 	1 	Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.
Psa 	106 	4 	1 	Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;
Psa 	106 	5 	1 	That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
Psa 	106 	6 	1 	We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
Psa 	106 	7 	1 	Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.
Psa 	106 	8 	1 	Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
Psa 	106 	9 	1 	He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
Psa 	106 	10 	1 	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
Psa 	106 	11 	1 	And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
Psa 	106 	12 	1 	Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
Psa 	106 	13 	1 	They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
Psa 	106 	14 	1 	But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
Psa 	106 	15 	1 	And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
Psa 	106 	16 	1 	They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.
Psa 	106 	17 	1 	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.
Psa 	106 	18 	1 	And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
Psa 	106 	19 	1 	They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
Psa 	106 	20 	1 	Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
Psa 	106 	21 	1 	They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;
Psa 	106 	22 	1 	Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.
Psa 	106 	23 	1 	Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
Psa 	106 	24 	1 	Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
Psa 	106 	25 	1 	But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.
Psa 	106 	26 	1 	Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
Psa 	106 	27 	1 	To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
Psa 	106 	28 	1 	They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
Psa 	106 	29 	1 	Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
Psa 	106 	30 	1 	Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.
Psa 	106 	31 	1 	And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
Psa 	106 	32 	1 	They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
Psa 	106 	33 	1 	Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Psa 	106 	34 	1 	They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
Psa 	106 	35 	1 	But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
Psa 	106 	36 	1 	And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
Psa 	106 	37 	1 	Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
Psa 	106 	38 	1 	And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
Psa 	106 	39 	1 	Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
Psa 	106 	40 	1 	Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
Psa 	106 	41 	1 	And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
Psa 	106 	42 	1 	Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
Psa 	106 	43 	1 	Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
Psa 	106 	44 	1 	Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
Psa 	106 	45 	1 	And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
Psa 	106 	46 	1 	He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
Psa 	106 	47 	1 	Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.
Psa 	106 	48 	1 	Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen.
Psa 	106 	48 	2 	Praise ye the LORD.
Psa 	107 	1 	1 	O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	107 	2 	1 	Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
Psa 	107 	3 	1 	And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
Psa 	107 	4 	1 	They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
Psa 	107 	5 	1 	Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
Psa 	107 	6 	1 	Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.
Psa 	107 	7 	1 	And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
Psa 	107 	8 	1 	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psa 	107 	9 	1 	For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Psa 	107 	10 	1 	Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;
Psa 	107 	11 	1 	Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:
Psa 	107 	12 	1 	Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.
Psa 	107 	13 	1 	Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.
Psa 	107 	14 	1 	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.
Psa 	107 	15 	1 	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psa 	107 	16 	1 	For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.
Psa 	107 	17 	1 	Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
Psa 	107 	18 	1 	Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.
Psa 	107 	19 	1 	Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.
Psa 	107 	20 	1 	He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.
Psa 	107 	21 	1 	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psa 	107 	22 	1 	And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.
Psa 	107 	23 	1 	They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;
Psa 	107 	24 	1 	These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
Psa 	107 	25 	1 	For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.
Psa 	107 	26 	1 	They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
Psa 	107 	27 	1 	They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.
Psa 	107 	28 	1 	Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.
Psa 	107 	29 	1 	He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
Psa 	107 	30 	1 	Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
Psa 	107 	31 	1 	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psa 	107 	32 	1 	Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
Psa 	107 	33 	1 	He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;
Psa 	107 	34 	1 	A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Psa 	107 	35 	1 	He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.
Psa 	107 	36 	1 	And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;
Psa 	107 	37 	1 	And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
Psa 	107 	38 	1 	He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
Psa 	107 	39 	1 	Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
Psa 	107 	40 	1 	He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.
Psa 	107 	41 	1 	Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.
Psa 	107 	42 	1 	The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
Psa 	107 	43 	1 	Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.
Psa 	108 	1 	1 	O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
Psa 	108 	2 	1 	Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
Psa 	108 	3 	1 	I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
Psa 	108 	4 	1 	For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.
Psa 	108 	5 	1 	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;
Psa 	108 	6 	1 	That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.
Psa 	108 	7 	1 	God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Psa 	108 	8 	1 	Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
Psa 	108 	9 	1 	Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.
Psa 	108 	10 	1 	Who will bring me into the strong city?
Psa 	108 	10 	2 	who will lead me into Edom?
Psa 	108 	11 	1 	Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off?
Psa 	108 	11 	2 	and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
Psa 	108 	12 	1 	Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Psa 	108 	13 	1 	Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
Psa 	109 	1 	1 	Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
Psa 	109 	2 	1 	For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
Psa 	109 	3 	1 	They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
Psa 	109 	4 	1 	For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.
Psa 	109 	5 	1 	And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
Psa 	109 	6 	1 	Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.
Psa 	109 	7 	1 	When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
Psa 	109 	8 	1 	Let his days be few; and let another take his office.
Psa 	109 	9 	1 	Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
Psa 	109 	10 	1 	Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.
Psa 	109 	11 	1 	Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.
Psa 	109 	12 	1 	Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.
Psa 	109 	13 	1 	Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
Psa 	109 	14 	1 	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
Psa 	109 	15 	1 	Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
Psa 	109 	16 	1 	Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
Psa 	109 	17 	1 	As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
Psa 	109 	18 	1 	As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Psa 	109 	19 	1 	Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
Psa 	109 	20 	1 	Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.
Psa 	109 	21 	1 	But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.
Psa 	109 	22 	1 	For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
Psa 	109 	23 	1 	I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
Psa 	109 	24 	1 	My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
Psa 	109 	25 	1 	I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.
Psa 	109 	26 	1 	Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
Psa 	109 	27 	1 	That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.
Psa 	109 	28 	1 	Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
Psa 	109 	29 	1 	Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
Psa 	109 	30 	1 	I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
Psa 	109 	31 	1 	For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.
Psa 	110 	1 	1 	The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
Psa 	110 	2 	1 	The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
Psa 	110 	3 	1 	Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.
Psa 	110 	4 	1 	The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
Psa 	110 	5 	1 	The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
Psa 	110 	6 	1 	He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.
Psa 	110 	7 	1 	He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
Psa 	111 	1 	1 	raise ye the LORD.
Psa 	111 	1 	2 	I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.
Psa 	111 	2 	1 	The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
Psa 	111 	3 	1 	His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
Psa 	111 	4 	1 	He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.
Psa 	111 	5 	1 	He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.
Psa 	111 	6 	1 	He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
Psa 	111 	7 	1 	The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.
Psa 	111 	8 	1 	They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.
Psa 	111 	9 	1 	He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.
Psa 	111 	10 	1 	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.
Psa 	112 	1 	1 	raise ye the LORD.
Psa 	112 	1 	2 	Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.
Psa 	112 	2 	1 	His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
Psa 	112 	3 	1 	Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
Psa 	112 	4 	1 	Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.
Psa 	112 	5 	1 	A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.
Psa 	112 	6 	1 	Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.
Psa 	112 	7 	1 	He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.
Psa 	112 	8 	1 	His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.
Psa 	112 	9 	1 	He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
Psa 	112 	10 	1 	The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
Psa 	113 	1 	1 	raise ye the LORD.
Psa 	113 	1 	2 	Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.
Psa 	113 	2 	1 	Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.
Psa 	113 	3 	1 	From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD's name is to be praised.
Psa 	113 	4 	1 	The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.
Psa 	113 	5 	1 	Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,
Psa 	113 	6 	1 	Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!
Psa 	113 	7 	1 	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
Psa 	113 	8 	1 	That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
Psa 	113 	9 	1 	He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children.
Psa 	113 	9 	2 	Praise ye the LORD.
Psa 	114 	1 	1 	When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
Psa 	114 	2 	1 	Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
Psa 	114 	3 	1 	The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
Psa 	114 	4 	1 	The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.
Psa 	114 	5 	1 	What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest?
Psa 	114 	5 	2 	thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?
Psa 	114 	6 	1 	Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?
Psa 	114 	7 	1 	Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
Psa 	114 	8 	1 	Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
Psa 	115 	1 	1 	Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.
Psa 	115 	2 	1 	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
Psa 	115 	3 	1 	But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.
Psa 	115 	4 	1 	Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
Psa 	115 	5 	1 	They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
Psa 	115 	6 	1 	They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
Psa 	115 	7 	1 	They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
Psa 	115 	8 	1 	They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.
Psa 	115 	9 	1 	O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
Psa 	115 	10 	1 	O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
Psa 	115 	11 	1 	Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
Psa 	115 	12 	1 	The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.
Psa 	115 	13 	1 	He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.
Psa 	115 	14 	1 	The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.
Psa 	115 	15 	1 	Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.
Psa 	115 	16 	1 	The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
Psa 	115 	17 	1 	The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.
Psa 	115 	18 	1 	But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.
Psa 	115 	18 	2 	Praise the LORD.
Psa 	116 	1 	1 	I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.
Psa 	116 	2 	1 	Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
Psa 	116 	3 	1 	The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
Psa 	116 	4 	1 	Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Psa 	116 	5 	1 	Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.
Psa 	116 	6 	1 	The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.
Psa 	116 	7 	1 	Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.
Psa 	116 	8 	1 	For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
Psa 	116 	9 	1 	I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
Psa 	116 	10 	1 	I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
Psa 	116 	11 	1 	I said in my haste, All men are liars.
Psa 	116 	12 	1 	What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?
Psa 	116 	13 	1 	I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.
Psa 	116 	14 	1 	I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.
Psa 	116 	15 	1 	recious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.
Psa 	116 	16 	1 	O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.
Psa 	116 	17 	1 	I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.
Psa 	116 	18 	1 	I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.
Psa 	116 	19 	1 	In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
Psa 	116 	19 	2 	Praise ye the LORD.
Psa 	117 	1 	1 	O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.
Psa 	117 	2 	1 	For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever.
Psa 	117 	2 	2 	Praise ye the LORD.
Psa 	118 	1 	1 	O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	118 	2 	1 	Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	118 	3 	1 	Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	118 	4 	1 	Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	118 	5 	1 	I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.
Psa 	118 	6 	1 	The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?
Psa 	118 	7 	1 	The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.
Psa 	118 	8 	1 	It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.
Psa 	118 	9 	1 	It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.
Psa 	118 	10 	1 	All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.
Psa 	118 	11 	1 	They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
Psa 	118 	12 	1 	They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
Psa 	118 	13 	1 	Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.
Psa 	118 	14 	1 	The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.
Psa 	118 	15 	1 	The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.
Psa 	118 	16 	1 	The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.
Psa 	118 	17 	1 	I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.
Psa 	118 	18 	1 	The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.
Psa 	118 	19 	1 	Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:
Psa 	118 	20 	1 	This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.
Psa 	118 	21 	1 	I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.
Psa 	118 	22 	1 	The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.
Psa 	118 	23 	1 	This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.
Psa 	118 	24 	1 	This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Psa 	118 	25 	1 	Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.
Psa 	118 	26 	1 	Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.
Psa 	118 	27 	1 	God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.
Psa 	118 	28 	1 	Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.
Psa 	118 	29 	1 	O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	119 	1 	1 	Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.
Psa 	119 	2 	1 	Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.
Psa 	119 	3 	1 	They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.
Psa 	119 	4 	1 	Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.
Psa 	119 	5 	1 	O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!
Psa 	119 	6 	1 	Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.
Psa 	119 	7 	1 	I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.
Psa 	119 	8 	1 	I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.
Psa 	119 	9 	1 	Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?
Psa 	119 	9 	2 	by taking heed thereto according to thy word.
Psa 	119 	10 	1 	With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.
Psa 	119 	11 	1 	Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.
Psa 	119 	12 	1 	Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.
Psa 	119 	13 	1 	With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.
Psa 	119 	14 	1 	I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.
Psa 	119 	15 	1 	I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.
Psa 	119 	16 	1 	I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.
Psa 	119 	17 	1 	Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.
Psa 	119 	18 	1 	Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.
Psa 	119 	19 	1 	I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.
Psa 	119 	20 	1 	My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.
Psa 	119 	21 	1 	Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.
Psa 	119 	22 	1 	Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.
Psa 	119 	23 	1 	rinces also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.
Psa 	119 	24 	1 	Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.leth.
Psa 	119 	25 	1 	My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.
Psa 	119 	26 	1 	I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.
Psa 	119 	27 	1 	Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.
Psa 	119 	28 	1 	My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.
Psa 	119 	29 	1 	Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.
Psa 	119 	30 	1 	I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.
Psa 	119 	31 	1 	I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.
Psa 	119 	32 	1 	I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.
Psa 	119 	33 	1 	Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.
Psa 	119 	34 	1 	Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.
Psa 	119 	35 	1 	Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.
Psa 	119 	36 	1 	Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.

Psa 	119 	38 	1 	Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.
Psa 	119 	39 	1 	Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.
Psa 	119 	40 	1 	Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.
Psa 	119 	41 	1 	Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.
Psa 	119 	42 	1 	So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.
Psa 	119 	43 	1 	And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.
Psa 	119 	44 	1 	So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.
Psa 	119 	45 	1 	And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.
Psa 	119 	46 	1 	I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.
Psa 	119 	47 	1 	And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.
Psa 	119 	48 	1 	My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.
Psa 	119 	49 	1 	Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.
Psa 	119 	50 	1 	This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.
Psa 	119 	51 	1 	The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.
Psa 	119 	52 	1 	I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.
Psa 	119 	53 	1 	Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
Psa 	119 	54 	1 	Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
Psa 	119 	55 	1 	I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.
Psa 	119 	56 	1 	This I had, because I kept thy precepts.
Psa 	119 	57 	1 	Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.
Psa 	119 	58 	1 	I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.
Psa 	119 	59 	1 	I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
Psa 	119 	60 	1 	I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.
Psa 	119 	61 	1 	The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.
Psa 	119 	62 	1 	At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.
Psa 	119 	63 	1 	I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.
Psa 	119 	64 	1 	The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.
Psa 	119 	65 	1 	Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.
Psa 	119 	66 	1 	Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.
Psa 	119 	67 	1 	Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.
Psa 	119 	68 	1 	Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.
Psa 	119 	69 	1 	The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.
Psa 	119 	70 	1 	Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.
Psa 	119 	71 	1 	It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.
Psa 	119 	72 	1 	The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.
Psa 	119 	73 	1 	Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.
Psa 	119 	74 	1 	They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.
Psa 	119 	75 	1 	I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.
Psa 	119 	76 	1 	Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.
Psa 	119 	77 	1 	Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.
Psa 	119 	78 	1 	Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.
Psa 	119 	79 	1 	Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.
Psa 	119 	80 	1 	Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.
Psa 	119 	81 	1 	My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.
Psa 	119 	82 	1 	Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?
Psa 	119 	83 	1 	For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.
Psa 	119 	84 	1 	How many are the days of thy servant?
Psa 	119 	84 	2 	when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
Psa 	119 	85 	1 	The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.
Psa 	119 	86 	1 	All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.
Psa 	119 	87 	1 	They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.
Psa 	119 	88 	1 	Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.
Psa 	119 	89 	1 	For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.
Psa 	119 	90 	1 	Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.
Psa 	119 	91 	1 	They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.
Psa 	119 	92 	1 	Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.
Psa 	119 	93 	1 	I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.
Psa 	119 	94 	1 	I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.
Psa 	119 	95 	1 	The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.
Psa 	119 	96 	1 	I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.
Psa 	119 	97 	1 	O how I love thy law!
Psa 	119 	97 	2 	it is my meditation all the day.
Psa 	119 	98 	1 	Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.
Psa 	119 	99 	1 	I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.
Psa 	119 	100 	1 	I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.
Psa 	119 	101 	1 	I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.
Psa 	119 	102 	1 	I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.
Psa 	119 	103 	1 	How sweet are thy words unto my taste!
Psa 	119 	103 	2 	yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
Psa 	119 	104 	1 	Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.
Psa 	119 	105 	1 	Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
Psa 	119 	106 	1 	I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.
Psa 	119 	107 	1 	I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.
Psa 	119 	108 	1 	Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.
Psa 	119 	109 	1 	My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.
Psa 	119 	110 	1 	The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.
Psa 	119 	111 	1 	Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.
Psa 	119 	112 	1 	I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.
Psa 	119 	113 	1 	I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.
Psa 	119 	114 	1 	Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.
Psa 	119 	115 	1 	Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.
Psa 	119 	116 	1 	Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.
Psa 	119 	117 	1 	Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.
Psa 	119 	118 	1 	Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.
Psa 	119 	119 	1 	Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.
Psa 	119 	120 	1 	My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.
Psa 	119 	121 	1 	I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.
Psa 	119 	122 	1 	Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.
Psa 	119 	123 	1 	Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.
Psa 	119 	124 	1 	Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.
Psa 	119 	125 	1 	I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.
Psa 	119 	126 	1 	It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law.
Psa 	119 	127 	1 	Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.
Psa 	119 	128 	1 	Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.
Psa 	119 	129 	1 	Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.
Psa 	119 	130 	1 	The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.
Psa 	119 	131 	1 	I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.
Psa 	119 	132 	1 	Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.
Psa 	119 	133 	1 	Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
Psa 	119 	134 	1 	Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.
Psa 	119 	135 	1 	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.
Psa 	119 	136 	1 	Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.
Psa 	119 	137 	1 	Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.
Psa 	119 	138 	1 	Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.
Psa 	119 	139 	1 	My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.
Psa 	119 	140 	1 	Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.
Psa 	119 	141 	1 	I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.
Psa 	119 	142 	1 	Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.
Psa 	119 	143 	1 	Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.
Psa 	119 	144 	1 	The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.
Psa 	119 	145 	1 	I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.
Psa 	119 	146 	1 	I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.
Psa 	119 	147 	1 	I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.
Psa 	119 	148 	1 	Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.
Psa 	119 	149 	1 	Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.
Psa 	119 	150 	1 	They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.
Psa 	119 	151 	1 	Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.
Psa 	119 	152 	1 	Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.
Psa 	119 	153 	1 	Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.
Psa 	119 	154 	1 	lead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.
Psa 	119 	155 	1 	Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.
Psa 	119 	156 	1 	Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.
Psa 	119 	157 	1 	Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.
Psa 	119 	158 	1 	I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.
Psa 	119 	159 	1 	Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.
Psa 	119 	160 	1 	Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.
Psa 	119 	161 	1 	rinces have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.
Psa 	119 	162 	1 	I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.
Psa 	119 	163 	1 	I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.
Psa 	119 	164 	1 	Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.
Psa 	119 	165 	1 	Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.
Psa 	119 	166 	1 	LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.
Psa 	119 	167 	1 	My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.
Psa 	119 	168 	1 	I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.
Psa 	119 	169 	1 	Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.
Psa 	119 	170 	1 	Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.
Psa 	119 	171 	1 	My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.
Psa 	119 	172 	1 	My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.
Psa 	119 	173 	1 	Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.
Psa 	119 	174 	1 	I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight.
Psa 	119 	175 	1 	Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.
Psa 	119 	176 	1 	I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.
Psa 	120 	1 	1 	In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.
Psa 	120 	2 	1 	Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.
Psa 	120 	3 	1 	What shall be given unto thee?
Psa 	120 	3 	2 	or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?
Psa 	120 	4 	1 	Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
Psa 	120 	5 	1 	Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
Psa 	120 	6 	1 	My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
Psa 	120 	7 	1 	I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.
Psa 	121 	1 	1 	I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
Psa 	121 	2 	1 	My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.
Psa 	121 	3 	1 	He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.
Psa 	121 	4 	1 	Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
Psa 	121 	5 	1 	The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.
Psa 	121 	6 	1 	The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
Psa 	121 	7 	1 	The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.
Psa 	121 	8 	1 	The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
Psa 	122 	1 	1 	I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.
Psa 	122 	2 	1 	Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
Psa 	122 	3 	1 	Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:
Psa 	122 	4 	1 	Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.
Psa 	122 	5 	1 	For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
Psa 	122 	6 	1 	ray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
Psa 	122 	7 	1 	eace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.
Psa 	122 	8 	1 	For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.
Psa 	122 	9 	1 	Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
Psa 	123 	1 	1 	Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Psa 	123 	2 	1 	Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
Psa 	123 	3 	1 	Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
Psa 	123 	4 	1 	Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
Psa 	124 	1 	1 	If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;
Psa 	124 	2 	1 	If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:
Psa 	124 	3 	1 	Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:
Psa 	124 	4 	1 	Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:
Psa 	124 	5 	1 	Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
Psa 	124 	6 	1 	Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
Psa 	124 	7 	1 	Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
Psa 	124 	8 	1 	Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
Psa 	125 	1 	1 	They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.
Psa 	125 	2 	1 	As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.
Psa 	125 	3 	1 	For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
Psa 	125 	4 	1 	Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.
Psa 	125 	5 	1 	As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.
Psa 	126 	1 	1 	When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
Psa 	126 	2 	1 	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.
Psa 	126 	3 	1 	The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
Psa 	126 	4 	1 	Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
Psa 	126 	5 	1 	They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
Psa 	126 	6 	1 	He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
Psa 	127 	1 	1 	Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
Psa 	127 	2 	1 	It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
Psa 	127 	3 	1 	Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.
Psa 	127 	4 	1 	As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.
Psa 	127 	5 	1 	Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
Psa 	128 	1 	1 	Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.
Psa 	128 	2 	1 	For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
Psa 	128 	3 	1 	Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
Psa 	128 	4 	1 	Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.
Psa 	128 	5 	1 	The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
Psa 	128 	6 	1 	Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.
Psa 	129 	1 	1 	Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:
Psa 	129 	2 	1 	Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.
Psa 	129 	3 	1 	The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.
Psa 	129 	4 	1 	The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
Psa 	129 	5 	1 	Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
Psa 	129 	6 	1 	Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:
Psa 	129 	7 	1 	Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
Psa 	129 	8 	1 	Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
Psa 	130 	1 	1 	Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.
Psa 	130 	2 	1 	Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
Psa 	130 	3 	1 	If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
Psa 	130 	4 	1 	But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
Psa 	130 	5 	1 	I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.
Psa 	130 	6 	1 	My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.
Psa 	130 	7 	1 	Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.
Psa 	130 	8 	1 	And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
Psa 	131 	1 	1 	Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.
Psa 	131 	2 	1 	Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
Psa 	131 	3 	1 	Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
Psa 	132 	1 	1 	Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:
Psa 	132 	2 	1 	How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;
Psa 	132 	3 	1 	Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;
Psa 	132 	4 	1 	I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,
Psa 	132 	5 	1 	Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.
Psa 	132 	6 	1 	Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.
Psa 	132 	7 	1 	We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.
Psa 	132 	8 	1 	Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Psa 	132 	9 	1 	Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.
Psa 	132 	10 	1 	For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.
Psa 	132 	11 	1 	The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
Psa 	132 	12 	1 	If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.
Psa 	132 	13 	1 	For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.
Psa 	132 	14 	1 	This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
Psa 	132 	15 	1 	I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.
Psa 	132 	16 	1 	I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
Psa 	132 	17 	1 	There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
Psa 	132 	18 	1 	His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
Psa 	133 	1 	1 	Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
Psa 	133 	2 	1 	It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;
Psa 	133 	3 	1 	As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
Psa 	134 	1 	1 	Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.
Psa 	134 	2 	1 	Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.
Psa 	134 	3 	1 	The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.
Psa 	135 	1 	1 	raise ye the LORD.
Psa 	135 	1 	2 	Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD.
Psa 	135 	2 	1 	Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.
Psa 	135 	3 	1 	raise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.
Psa 	135 	4 	1 	For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.
Psa 	135 	5 	1 	For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.
Psa 	135 	6 	1 	Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.
Psa 	135 	7 	1 	He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.
Psa 	135 	8 	1 	Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
Psa 	135 	9 	1 	Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
Psa 	135 	10 	1 	Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
Psa 	135 	11 	1 	Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:
Psa 	135 	12 	1 	And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.
Psa 	135 	13 	1 	Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.
Psa 	135 	14 	1 	For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.
Psa 	135 	15 	1 	The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
Psa 	135 	16 	1 	They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
Psa 	135 	17 	1 	They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.
Psa 	135 	18 	1 	They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.
Psa 	135 	19 	1 	Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:
Psa 	135 	20 	1 	Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.
Psa 	135 	21 	1 	Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.
Psa 	135 	21 	2 	Praise ye the LORD.
Psa 	136 	1 	1 	O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	136 	2 	1 	O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	136 	3 	1 	O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	136 	4 	1 	To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	136 	5 	1 	To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	136 	6 	1 	To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	136 	7 	1 	To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever:
Psa 	136 	8 	1 	The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:
Psa 	136 	9 	1 	The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	136 	10 	1 	To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever:
Psa 	136 	11 	1 	And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever:
Psa 	136 	12 	1 	With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	136 	13 	1 	To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever:
Psa 	136 	14 	1 	And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever:
Psa 	136 	15 	1 	But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	136 	16 	1 	To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	136 	17 	1 	To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:
Psa 	136 	18 	1 	And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:
Psa 	136 	19 	1 	Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:
Psa 	136 	20 	1 	And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:
Psa 	136 	21 	1 	And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever:
Psa 	136 	22 	1 	Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	136 	23 	1 	Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for ever:
Psa 	136 	24 	1 	And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	136 	25 	1 	Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	136 	26 	1 	O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa 	137 	1 	1 	By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
Psa 	137 	2 	1 	We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
Psa 	137 	3 	1 	For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
Psa 	137 	4 	1 	How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?
Psa 	137 	5 	1 	If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.
Psa 	137 	6 	1 	If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.
Psa 	137 	7 	1 	Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.
Psa 	137 	8 	1 	O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
Psa 	137 	9 	1 	Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
Psa 	138 	1 	1 	I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.
Psa 	138 	2 	1 	I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
Psa 	138 	3 	1 	In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.
Psa 	138 	4 	1 	All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.
Psa 	138 	5 	1 	Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD.
Psa 	138 	6 	1 	Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.
Psa 	138 	7 	1 	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.
Psa 	138 	8 	1 	The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.
Psa 	139 	1 	1 	O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.
Psa 	139 	2 	1 	Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
Psa 	139 	3 	1 	Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.
Psa 	139 	4 	1 	For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
Psa 	139 	5 	1 	Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.
Psa 	139 	6 	1 	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.
Psa 	139 	7 	1 	Whither shall I go from thy spirit?
Psa 	139 	7 	2 	or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
Psa 	139 	8 	1 	If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
Psa 	139 	9 	1 	If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
Psa 	139 	10 	1 	Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
Psa 	139 	11 	1 	If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.
Psa 	139 	12 	1 	Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
Psa 	139 	13 	1 	For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
Psa 	139 	14 	1 	I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.
Psa 	139 	15 	1 	My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
Psa 	139 	16 	1 	Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
Psa 	139 	17 	1 	How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God!
Psa 	139 	17 	2 	how great is the sum of them!
Psa 	139 	18 	1 	If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.
Psa 	139 	19 	1 	Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
Psa 	139 	20 	1 	For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.
Psa 	139 	21 	1 	Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee?
Psa 	139 	21 	2 	and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
Psa 	139 	22 	1 	I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
Psa 	139 	23 	1 	Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
Psa 	139 	24 	1 	And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
Psa 	140 	1 	1 	Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;
Psa 	140 	2 	1 	Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war.
Psa 	140 	3 	1 	They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips.
Psa 	140 	3 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	140 	4 	1 	Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.
Psa 	140 	5 	1 	The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me.
Psa 	140 	5 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	140 	6 	1 	I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.
Psa 	140 	7 	1 	O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
Psa 	140 	8 	1 	Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves.
Psa 	140 	8 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	140 	9 	1 	As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
Psa 	140 	10 	1 	Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
Psa 	140 	11 	1 	Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
Psa 	140 	12 	1 	I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.
Psa 	140 	13 	1 	Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
Psa 	141 	1 	1 	Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
Psa 	141 	2 	1 	Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
Psa 	141 	3 	1 	Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
Psa 	141 	4 	1 	Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.
Psa 	141 	5 	1 	Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.
Psa 	141 	6 	1 	When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
Psa 	141 	7 	1 	Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.
Psa 	141 	8 	1 	But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
Psa 	141 	9 	1 	Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.
Psa 	141 	10 	1 	Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
Psa 	142 	1 	1 	I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.
Psa 	142 	2 	1 	I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.
Psa 	142 	3 	1 	When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path.
Psa 	142 	3 	2 	In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
Psa 	142 	4 	1 	I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.
Psa 	142 	5 	1 	I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.
Psa 	142 	6 	1 	Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
Psa 	142 	7 	1 	Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
Psa 	143 	1 	1 	Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.
Psa 	143 	2 	1 	And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
Psa 	143 	3 	1 	For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
Psa 	143 	4 	1 	Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.
Psa 	143 	5 	1 	I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.
Psa 	143 	6 	1 	I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land.
Psa 	143 	6 	2 	Selah.
Psa 	143 	7 	1 	Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
Psa 	143 	8 	1 	Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.
Psa 	143 	9 	1 	Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.
Psa 	143 	10 	1 	Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.
Psa 	143 	11 	1 	Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.
Psa 	143 	12 	1 	And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.
Psa 	144 	1 	1 	Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:
Psa 	144 	2 	1 	My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.
Psa 	144 	3 	1 	LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him!
Psa 	144 	3 	2 	or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!
Psa 	144 	4 	1 	Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.
Psa 	144 	5 	1 	Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
Psa 	144 	6 	1 	Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.
Psa 	144 	7 	1 	Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;
Psa 	144 	8 	1 	Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
Psa 	144 	9 	1 	I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
Psa 	144 	10 	1 	It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
Psa 	144 	11 	1 	Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:
Psa 	144 	12 	1 	That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:
Psa 	144 	13 	1 	That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:
Psa 	144 	14 	1 	That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.
Psa 	144 	15 	1 	Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.
Psa 	145 	1 	1 	I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
Psa 	145 	2 	1 	Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
Psa 	145 	3 	1 	Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.
Psa 	145 	4 	1 	One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.
Psa 	145 	5 	1 	I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.
Psa 	145 	6 	1 	And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness.
Psa 	145 	7 	1 	They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.
Psa 	145 	8 	1 	The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.
Psa 	145 	9 	1 	The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.
Psa 	145 	10 	1 	All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee.
Psa 	145 	11 	1 	They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;
Psa 	145 	12 	1 	To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.
Psa 	145 	13 	1 	Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
Psa 	145 	14 	1 	The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.
Psa 	145 	15 	1 	The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.
Psa 	145 	16 	1 	Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
Psa 	145 	17 	1 	The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.
Psa 	145 	18 	1 	The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.
Psa 	145 	19 	1 	He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
Psa 	145 	20 	1 	The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.
Psa 	145 	21 	1 	My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
Psa 	146 	1 	1 	raise ye the LORD.
Psa 	146 	1 	2 	Praise the LORD, O my soul.
Psa 	146 	2 	1 	While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
Psa 	146 	3 	1 	ut not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
Psa 	146 	4 	1 	His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
Psa 	146 	5 	1 	Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:
Psa 	146 	6 	1 	Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:
Psa 	146 	7 	1 	Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry.
Psa 	146 	7 	2 	The LORD looseth the prisoners:
Psa 	146 	8 	1 	The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:
Psa 	146 	9 	1 	The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
Psa 	146 	10 	1 	The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations.
Psa 	146 	10 	2 	Praise ye the LORD.
Psa 	147 	1 	1 	raise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.
Psa 	147 	2 	1 	The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.
Psa 	147 	3 	1 	He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.
Psa 	147 	4 	1 	He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.
Psa 	147 	5 	1 	Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.
Psa 	147 	6 	1 	The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.
Psa 	147 	7 	1 	Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:
Psa 	147 	8 	1 	Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.
Psa 	147 	9 	1 	He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.
Psa 	147 	10 	1 	He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.
Psa 	147 	11 	1 	The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.
Psa 	147 	12 	1 	raise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.
Psa 	147 	13 	1 	For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.
Psa 	147 	14 	1 	He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.
Psa 	147 	15 	1 	He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.
Psa 	147 	16 	1 	He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.
Psa 	147 	17 	1 	He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?
Psa 	147 	18 	1 	He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
Psa 	147 	19 	1 	He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.
Psa 	147 	20 	1 	He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them.
Psa 	147 	20 	2 	Praise ye the LORD.
Psa 	148 	1 	1 	raise ye the LORD.
Psa 	148 	1 	2 	Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights.
Psa 	148 	2 	1 	raise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.
Psa 	148 	3 	1 	raise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.
Psa 	148 	4 	1 	raise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens.
Psa 	148 	5 	1 	Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.
Psa 	148 	6 	1 	He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.
Psa 	148 	7 	1 	raise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:
Psa 	148 	8 	1 	Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word:
Psa 	148 	9 	1 	Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:
Psa 	148 	10 	1 	Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:
Psa 	148 	11 	1 	Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:
Psa 	148 	12 	1 	Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:
Psa 	148 	13 	1 	Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.
Psa 	148 	14 	1 	He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him.
Psa 	148 	14 	2 	Praise ye the LORD.
Psa 	149 	1 	1 	raise ye the LORD.
Psa 	149 	1 	2 	Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints.
Psa 	149 	2 	1 	Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
Psa 	149 	3 	1 	Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.
Psa 	149 	4 	1 	For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.
Psa 	149 	5 	1 	Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.
Psa 	149 	6 	1 	Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand;
Psa 	149 	7 	1 	To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people;
Psa 	149 	8 	1 	To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;
Psa 	149 	9 	1 	To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints.
Psa 	149 	9 	2 	Praise ye the LORD.
Psa 	150 	1 	1 	raise ye the LORD.
Psa 	150 	1 	2 	Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.
Psa 	150 	2 	1 	raise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.
Psa 	150 	3 	1 	raise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp.
Psa 	150 	4 	1 	raise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.
Psa 	150 	5 	1 	raise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.
Psa 	150 	6 	1 	Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD.
Psa 	150 	6 	2 	Praise ye the LORD.
